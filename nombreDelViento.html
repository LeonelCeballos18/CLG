    all those last weeks I spent there, there was a peculiar evil feeling

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What?
    Battle Royale? &quot;What's Battle Royale?&quot; Come on, don't tell
    me you don't know that!? Why bother coming to a pro wrestling match,
    huh? The name of a move? The name of a tournament? No, Battle
    Royale's a pro wrestling match. What? &quot;Today?&quot; Today, here,
    you mean? No, it's not today's&nbsp;program. It's only held in large
    arenas for big events. Look, there's Takako Inoue. O-oh, sorry.
    That's right, a Battle Royale. It's still held in the All Japan Pro
    Wrestling League. In a nutshell, let's see Battle Royale is—you
    know how your usual pro wrestling match is one on one or between
    paired up partners, well with Battle Royale, ten or twenty wrestlers
    all jump into the ring. And then you're free to attack anyone, one on
    one, or ten against one, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how
    many wrestlers pin someone down—what, you don't even know what a
    pin is? Once your back's on the mat, the count goes, one, two, three,
    you lose. It's no different from a normal match. Players can also
    forfeit, and occasionally someone'll get knocked out. Oh yeah, and
    there's the count out. You can also be disqualified by breaking the
    rules. Most wrestlers lose by falls in Battle Royale. Hey, go Takako,
    go! Go, go! O-oh, sorry sorry. In any case, the ones who fall lose,
    they have to leave the ring. Fewer and fewer players remain in the
    game. There're only two left in the end. One on one, a very serious
    match. One out of those two will eventually take a fall. Then there's
    only one player left in the ring, and he's the winner. He wins. He's
    given a huge trophy and prize money. Get it? Huh? What about players
    who've been friends? Well, at first, of course they help each other
    out. But in the end they have to fight each other. You have to follow
    the rules. Which also means you get to watch some rare matches. Like
    way back when the tag-team partners of Dynamite Kid and Davey Boy
    Smith were the remaining players. Same thing happened with tag-team
    partners Animal Warrior and Hawk Warrior. In that match though I
    don't remember which one, but the guy intentionally went for a count
    out letting his partner win, a display of camaraderie which was kind
    of a letdown. Oh, you can also team up with players who used to be
    your enemies.&nbsp;But the moment you think you're teaming up to get
    rid of someone else, this sneaky friend can suddenly betray and beat
    you. Let's see, a Battle Royale I'd like to see now? Well given how
    many federations there are, I'd like to see a Battle Royale between
    the leaders of each federation. Keiji Mutoh, Shinya Hashimoto,
    Mitsuharu Misawa, Toshiaki Kawada, Nobuhiko Takada, Masakatsu Funaki,
    Akira Maeda, Great Sasuke, Hayabusa, Kenji Takano, also Genichiro
    Tenryu, Riki Choshu, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Kengo Kimura could still
    be in the running. It'd be fun to add Yoji Anjoh and Super Delfin.
    They might actually end up being the last two remaining players. For
    women's first of all, Takako, then Aja Kong, Manami Toyota, Kyoko
    Inoue, Yumiko Hotta, Akira Hokuto, Bull Nakano, of course Dynamite
    Kansai, and Cutey Suzuki and Hikari Fukuoka, Mayumi Ozaki, Shinobu
    Kandori, and Chigusa Nagayo and...what? How could you not know any of
    them? Did you really come here to watch pro wrestling? Oh, no no no
    no no, Takako, fight back ! Takako! All—right.</font></font></p>

    the bus entered the prefectural capital of Takamatsu, garden suburbs
    transformed into city streets of multicolored neon, headlights of
    oncoming cars, and checkered lights of office buildings. A group of
    well dressed men and women stood talking to each other in front of a
    streetside restaurant while they waited for a taxi. Tired, squatting
    youths smoked in the clean parking lot of a convenience store. A
    worker on his bicycle waited for the lights to change at the
    crossing. It was chilly for a May evening, so the man had put on his
    worn out jacket. Along with these other drifting impressions, the
    worker disappeared behind the bus window, swallowed by the low engine
    rumble. The digital display above the bus driver's head changed to
    8:57.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    Nanahara (Male Student No. 15, Third Year Class B, Shiroiwa Junior
    High School, Shiroiwa Town, Kagawa Prefecture) had been staring
    outside, leaning over Yoshitoki Kuninobu (Male Student No. 7), who
    had the window seat. As Yoshitoki dug through his bag, Shuya stared
    at his own right foot, which was sticking out in the aisle, and
    stretched out his Keds sneakers with his toes. It used to be that
    Keds weren't hard to find, but now they were extremely rare. The
    canvas of Shuya's shoes were torn on the right heel, and the stray
    threads stuck out like cat's whiskers. The shoe company was American,
    but the shoes themselves were made in Colombia. At present, 1997, the
    Republic of Greater East Asia hardly suffered from a shortage of
    goods. In fact it was rich with commodities, but imports were hard to
    come by lately. Well, it was only to be expected in a country with an
    official policy of isolationism. Besides, America—both the
    government and the textbooks called them &quot;the American
    Imperialists&quot;—was an enemy state.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From
    the back of the bus, Shuya watched his forty-one classmates, who were
    illuminated by dull fluorescent lights fixed in dingy ceiling panels.
    They were all in the same class from last year. They were all still
    excited and chatting away, since hardly an hour had passed since
    their departure from their hometown of Shiroiwa. Spending the first
    night of a study trip on a bus seemed a little cheap. Worse yet, it
    felt like they were going on a forced march. But everyone would calm
    down once the bus crossed the Seto Bridge and got on the Sanyo
    Highway and headed towards their destination, the island of Kyushu.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    loud students at the front who were sitting around their teacher Mr.
    Hayashida were girls: Yukie Utsumi (Female Student No. 2), the class
    representative who looked good with braided hair; Haruka Tanizawa
    (Female Student No. 12), her volleyball teammate who was
    exceptionally tall; Izumi Kanai (Female Student No. 5), the preppy
    whose father was a town representative; Satomi Noda (Female&nbsp;Student
    No. 17), the model student who wore wire-rimmed glasses which suited
    her calm, intelligent face; and Chisato Matsui (Female Student No.
    19), who was always quiet and withdrawn. They were the mainstream
    girls. You could call them &quot;the neutrals.&quot; Girls tended to
    form cliques, but there weren't any particular groups that stuck out
    in Shiroiwa Junior High School's Third Year Class B, so categorizing
    them didn't seem right. If there was a group, it was the rebel or—to
    put it more bluntly—the </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>delinquent</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    group led by Mitsuko Souma (Female Student No. 11). Hirono Shimizu
    (Female Student No. 10) and Yoshimi Yahagi (Female Student No. 21)
    rounded out that bunch. Shuya couldn't see them from where he was
    sitting.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    seats right behind the driver were slightly raised, and popping up
    above them were the two heads of Kazuhiko Yamamoto (Male Student No.
    21) and Sakura Ogawa (Female Student No. 4), the most intimate couple
    in the class. Maybe they were laughing, because their heads shook
    slightly. They were so insular, the most trivial thing could have
    been entertaining them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Closer
    to Shuya, lying in the aisle, was a large school uniform. It belonged
    to Yoshio Akamatsu (Male Student No. 1). He was the biggest kid in
    the class, but he was the timid type, the kind of kid who'd always
    end up the target of pranks and insults. His big body was crouched
    over, and he was busy playing a handheld video game.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Also
    in the aisle were the jocks Tatsumichi Oki (Male Student No. 3,
    handball team), Kazushi Niida (Male Student No. 16, soccer team), and
    Tadakatsu Hatagami (Male Student No. 18). They were all sitting
    together. Shuya himself had played Little League baseball in
    elementary school and was known as a star shortstop. Actually he'd
    been friends with Tadakatsu, but they'd stopped hanging out. Partly
    this was because Shuya had stopped playing baseball, but it also had
    to do with the fact that Shuya had started playing electric guitar,
    which was considered an &quot;unpatriotic&quot; activity. Tadakatsu's
    mother was uptight about that sort of thing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes,
    rock was outlawed in this country. (Of course there were loopholes.
    Shuya's electric guitar came with a government-approved sticker which
    read, &quot;DECADENT MUSIC IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.&quot; Decadent
    music was rock.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Come
    to think of it</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Shuya thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I've
    changed my friends too</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    heard someone laugh quietly behind big Yoshio Akamatsu. It was one of
    Shuya's new friends, Shinji Mimura. Shinji had short hair and wore an
    intricately designed ring on his left ear. By the time Shuya and
    Shinji became classmates in their second year, Shuya had already
    heard of him. Shinji was known as &quot;The Third Man&quot;—the
    team's first-string shooting guard. His athletic skill was equal to
    Shuya's, though Shinji would have said, &quot;I'm better, bro.&quot;
    Together on the basketball court for the first time in their
    second-year class competition, they made for a deadly combo, so it
    was only natural they'd hit it off. There was a lot more to Shinji
    than sports, though. His grades in subjects other than math and
    English weren't great, but his breadth of real world knowledge was
    incredible, and his views were mature, way beyond his peers. He
    somehow had an answer for any question about overseas information
    that couldn't be obtained in this country. And he always knew the
    best thing to say when you were down, like, &quot;You know it, I'm
    the man.&quot; But he was never arrogant. Instead he'd smile and
    crack a joke. He was never full of himself. Basically Shinji Mimura
    was a good guy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    appeared to be sitting next to his buddy from grade school, Yutaka
    Seto (Male Student No. 12), the class clown. Yutaka must have cracked
    another joke, because Shinji was laughing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    Sugimura (Male Student No. 11) sat behind them. His tall, lanky body
    barely fit into the narrow seat. He was reading a paperback book.
    Hiroki was reserved and studied martial arts, so he projected
    toughness. He didn't hang out with the other guys much, but once you
    got to know him a little he turned&nbsp;out to be nice. He was just
    shy. Shuya got along with him. Was he reading that book of Chinese
    poetry he liked so much? (Chinese books in translation were fairly
    easy to obtain, not surprising considering the Republic claimed China
    as &quot;part of our homeland.&quot;)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    once came across a line in an American paperback novel he'd dug out
    from a used bookstore (he managed to get through it with a
    dictionary): </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>friends
    come and then they go</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Maybe that's how things were. Just as he and Tadakatsu were no longer
    friends, there might come a time when he wasn't friends with Shinji
    and Hiroki anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Well,
    maybe not.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    glanced at Yoshitoki Kuninobu, who was still digging through his bag.
    Shuya had made it this far with Yoshitoki Kuninobu. And that would
    never change. After all they were friends ever since they wet their
    beds at that Catholic institution with the bombastic name, &quot;the
    Charity House&quot;—where orphans or other children who, due to
    &quot;circumstances,&quot; were no longer able to be with their
    parents. You could say they were almost cursed to be friends.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    we should cover religion while we're at it. In fact this country,
    under a unique system of national socialism ruled over by an
    executive authority called &quot;the Dictator&quot; (Shinji Mimura
    once said with a grimace, &quot;This is what they call 'successful
    fascism.' Where else in the world could you find something so
    sinister?&quot;), had no national religion. The closest thing to
    religion was faith in the political system— but this wasn't paired
    up with any established religion. Religious practice therefore was
    permitted as long as it remained moderate and at the same time wasn't
    guaranteed. So it was only practiced in private by dedicated
    followers. Shuya himself never really had any religious inclinations,
    but it was thanks to this particular religion's institution that he
    managed to grow up relatively unscathed and normal. He thought he
    should appreciate that much. There were state orphanages, but
    apparently their accommodations and programs were poorly run, and
    from what he heard they served as training schools for Special
    Defense Forces soldiers.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned around and looked back. The group of delinquents that included
    Ryuhei Sasagawa (Male Student No. 10) and Mitsuru Numai (Male Student
    No. 17) was sitting on the wide seat at the back of the bus. There
    was...Shuya couldn't see his face, but he could see between the seats
    the head with the oddly styled, slicked-back, long hair poking out by
    the right window. Though on its left side (well, it seemed Ryuhei
    Sasagawa had left two seats open in between) the others were talking
    and laughing over something dirty, the head remained absolutely
    still. Perhaps he'd fallen asleep. Or maybe like Shuya he was
    watching the city lights.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was completely baffled by the fact that this boy— Kazuo Kiriyama
    (Male Student No. 6)—would actually participate in a childish
    activity like a study trip.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kiriyama
    was the leader of the thugs in their district, a group that included
    Ryuhei and Mitsuru. Kiriyama was by no means big. At best he was the
    same height as Shuya, but he could easily pin down high school
    students and even take on local yakuza. His reputation was legendary
    throughout the entire prefecture. And his father being the president
    of a leading corporation didn't hurt. (There were rumors though that
    he was an illegitimate child. Shuya wasn't interested, so he never
    bothered to find out more.) Of course that wouldn't have been enough.
    He had a handsome, intelligent face, and his voice wasn't
    particularly low, but there was something intimidating about it. He
    was the top student in Class B, and the only one who barely kept up
    with him was Kyoichi Motobuchi (Male Student No. 20), who studied so
    hard he didn't get much sleep. In sports Kazuo was better and more
    graceful than almost anyone else in the class. The only ones at
    Shiroiwa Junior High who could compete with him seriously were, yes,
    the former star shortstop, Shuya, and the current star shooting
    guard, Shinji Mimura. So in every respect Kazuo Kiriyama was perfect.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then how could someone this perfect end up a leader of thugs? That
    was really none of Shuya's business. But if there was one thing Shuya
    could tell, it was a sense, almost tactile, that Kazuo was different.
    Shuya couldn't say exactly how. Kazuo never did anything bad in
    school. He'd never bully around someone like Yoshio Akamatsu the way
    Ryuhei Sasagawa did. But there was something so...remote about him.
    Was that it? At least that's how it felt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was absent a lot. The idea of Kazuo &quot;studying&quot; was
    completely absurd. In every class Kiriyama remained quietly seated at
    his desk as if he were thinking of something that had nothing to do
    with class. Shuya thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>if
    the government didn't have the power to enforce compulsory education
    on us, he probably wouldn't come to school at all. On the other hand
    he might just show up on a whim. I don't know.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    In any case, Shuya thought, I expected Kazuo to skip something as
    trivial as a study trip, but then he promptly shows up. Was this on a
    whim too?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was staring at the ceiling panel lights wondering about Kiriyama when
    a perky voice interrupted his thoughts. From the seat across the
    aisle, Noriko Nakagawa (Female Student No. 15) offered something
    wrapped in crisp cellophane. The bag sparkled like water under the
    white light, and it was filled with light-brown discs—cookies,
    probably. On top was a bow tied with a gold ribbon.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    Nakagawa was another girl who was neutral like Yukie Utsumi's group.
    Other than her kind eyes, which were noticeably dark, she had a
    round, girlish face and shoulder-length hair. She was petite and
    playful. In short, she was an average girl. If there was something
    particular about her, it was probably the fact that she wrote the
    best compositions in literature class. (This was how Shuya got to
    know Noriko. Shuya would spend break periods writing lyrics for his
    songs in the margins of his notebooks, and Noriko would insist on
    reading them.) She usually hung with Yukie's group, but because she'd
    showed up late today, she had no other choice but to take an open
    seat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    half extended his hand and raised his brow. For some reason Noriko
    became flustered and said, &quot;They're leftovers from the ones my
    brother begged me to bake. They're best fresh, so I brought them for
    you and Mr. Nobu.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Mr.
    Nobu&quot; was Yoshitoki Kuninobu's nickname. Although he had
    bulging, friendly eyes, the nickname seemed appropriate for someone
    who could be, oddly enough, mature and wise. None of the girls called
    him by that name, but Noriko had no problem calling the boys by their
    nicknames, and the fact that this hardly offended any of them
    indicated how uniquely disarming she was. (Shuya had a sports-related
    nickname, the same name as a famous cigarette brand, but in the same
    way that Shinji was referred to as &quot;The Third Man&quot; no one
    called him by this to his face.) He'd already noticed this before,
    Shuya observed, but she's the only girl who calls me by my first
    name.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki,
    who'd been listening in on them, interrupted. &quot;Really? For us?
    Thanks so much! If you made them, I bet they're delicious.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    snatched the bag from Shuya's hand, quickly untied the ribbon, and
    took out a cookie.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wow,
    these are awesome.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Yoshitoki praised Noriko, Shuya grinned. Could he be more obvious?
    The moment Noriko sat next to Shuya he'd been repeatedly glancing
    over at her, sitting upright, completely nervous.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a month and a half ago during spring vacation. Shuya and
    Yoshitoki had gone fishing for black bass at the dam reservoir that
    provided the city its water supply. Yoshitoki confessed to Shuya,
    &quot;Hey Shuya, I got a crush on someone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh.
    Who is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Nakagawa.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    mean from our class?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Which
    one? There are two Nakagawas. Yuka Nakagawa?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    unlike you, I'm not into fat girls.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    the...? So you're saying Kazumi is fat? She's just a little plump.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sorry.
    Anyway, well, uh yeah, it's Noriko.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh.
    Well, she's nice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&nbsp;&quot;Isn't
    she though? Isn't she?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right, all right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes,
    Yoshitoki was totally obvious. But in spite of his behavior Noriko
    seemed oblivious to Yoshitoki's feelings for her. Maybe she was slow
    with stuff like this or something. It wasn't surprising, given her
    personality.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a cookie from the bag still in Yoshitoki's hand and examined it.
    Then he looked over at Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    they lose their flavor?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh
    huh,&quot; she nodded. Her eyes strained, oddly. &quot;That's right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Which
    means you're sure they taste pretty good.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    might have learned this form of sarcasm from Shinji Mimura. Shuya
    often used it lately, to the dismay of other classmates, but Noriko
    just emitted a happy laugh and said, &quot;I guess so.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on,&quot; Yoshitoki interrupted again. &quot;I told you they were
    good, didn't I, Noriko?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    smiled. &quot;Thanks. You're so nice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    all of a sudden froze up as if he'd jammed his finger into an
    electric outlet and turned mute. Staring silently into his lap, he
    proceeded to devour his cookie.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    grinned and ate the rest of his cookie. The warm, sweet taste and
    smell spread through his mouth.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;These
    are good,&quot; Shuya said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko,
    who'd been observing him all this time, exclaimed, &quot;Thank you!&quot;
    He could be wrong, but somehow the tone of her voice was different
    than when she thanked Yoshitoki. Well, wait...true, she was staring
    at him while he was eating the cookie. Were they really leftovers
    from the batch she'd baked for her brother? Maybe she'd baked them
    for &quot;someone else.&quot; Or maybe he was just plain wrong.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    for some reason Shuya thought of Kazumi. She was a year ahead, and a
    fellow music club member until last year.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the Republic of Greater East Asia, rock music was strictly prohibited
    in school club activities, but</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	when
    their adviser Ms. Miyata was absent, music club members would play
    rock on their own. That was the kind of membership the club attracted
    in the first place anyway. Kazumi Shintani was the best female
    saxophone player. When it came to rock saxophone though, she was the
    best in the entire club. She was tall (almost the same height as
    Shuya, who stood 170 centimeters) and plump, but with her remarkably
    mature face and her hair bundled by her shoulders, she looked awesome
    with her alto saxophone. Shuya was thrilled by the sight. Then she
    taught Shuya how to play difficult guitar chords. (She said, &quot;I
    played a little before I started playing the saxophone.&quot;) From
    that point on Shuya spent every spare minute he had practicing his
    guitar, and by his second year he was the best player in the club. It
    was all because he wanted Kazumi to hear him play.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    one day, when the two of them happened to be alone in the music room
    after school, Shuya played and sang a version of &quot;Summertime
    Blues&quot; which impressed her. &quot;That was so great, Shuya. That
    was so awesome.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    day Shuya bought a can of beer for the first time in his life and
    celebrated with a private toast. It tasted great. But three days
    later when he asked her out, confessing, &quot;Um, I really like
    you,&quot; she responded, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm already going out with
    someone.&quot; She graduated and went to a high school with a music
    department, along with her &quot;boyfriend.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Which
    reminded Shuya of his conversation with Yoshitoki at the dam over
    spring break. After sharing his feelings for Noriko, Yoshitoki asked
    him, &quot;Are you still hung up on Kazumi?&quot; Shuya answered,
    &quot;Yeah, I think I'll be hung up over her the rest of my life.&quot;
    Yoshitoki looked stumped. &quot;But she has a boyfriend, right?&quot;
    Throwing the silver lure with all his might as if throwing a ball in
    from the outfield, he answered, &quot;That doesn't matter.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took the bag of cookies from Yoshitoki, who was still staring down
    into his lap. &quot;Aren't you going to leave some for Noriko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;O-oh
    yeah, I'm sorry.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    returned the bag to Noriko.&nbsp;&quot;Sorry about that.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    all right. I don't mind. You guys should take them all.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Really?
    But we shouldn't be the only ones.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took his first glance at the guy sitting next to Noriko. Wrapped in
    his school uniform, Shogo Kawada (Male Student No. 5) leaned against
    the window with his arms crossed and his eyes closed. He might have
    been asleep. His hair was cropped so short he looked like a monk. His
    slightly stubbled face reminded Shuya of a punk racketeer at a
    carnival. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Wow,
    facial hair, everyone! Doesn't he look kind of old for a junior high
    school student?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Well,
    there was one thing he knew. Although Class B consisted of the same
    students as it did last year, Shogo Kawada had transferred last April
    from Kobe. And due to some circumstance, an injury or illness (he
    didn't look like the bedridden type so it must have been an injury),
    Kawada had to stay behind a year because he was unable to attend
    school for over six months. In other words he was one year older than
    Shuya and his classmates. Shuya himself never told anyone this, but
    that was what Shuya had heard.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    fact he hadn't heard good things about Shogo. There was a rumor that
    he'd been a notorious thug at his last school and that his
    hospitalization was a result of a fight. To support this rumor, his
    body was covered with scars. A long scar from what appeared to be a
    knife wound ran over his left brow, and when they changed in the gym
    lockers (this was besides the point, but Kawada's body was built like
    a middleweight boxer's), Shuya was shocked to find the same kind of
    scars covering his arms and back. There were two round scars next to
    each other on his left shoulder. They looked like gunshot wounds, but
    that was unbelievable.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Every
    time he heard these rumors about Shogo, someone would inevitably
    suggest, &quot;He's probably going to end up fighting Kazuo.&quot;
    Right after Shogo transferred to their school that fool Ryuhei
    Sasagawa tried to intimidate Shogo. The exact details of what
    followed were only hearsay, but apparently Ryuhei turned pale,
    retreated, and went crying for help from Kazuo. Kazuo looked
    indifferent though, and only glanced at Ryuhei. He didn't even say a
    word to Shogo. So at least for the time being they'd managed to avoid
    a confrontation. Kazuo didn't seem interested in Shogo. Shogo didn't
    seem interested in Kazuo. As a result Class B remained peaceful. They
    lucked out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everybody
    avoided Shogo because of his age difference and the rumors. But Shuya
    didn't like judging people on rumors. Someone once said, if you could
    see for yourself then there'd be no need to lend an ear to what
    others said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pointed his chin past Noriko toward Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    wonder if he's sleeping.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hmm...&quot;
    She glanced over at Shogo.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    didn't want to wake him up.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;He
    doesn't look like the type who's into cookies anyway.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    chuckled, and as Shuya was about to, they heard, &quot;No thanks.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    glanced back at Shogo.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    strong, low voice echoed in his head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    Shuya wasn't familiar with the voice it obviously came from Shogo,
    who still kept his eyes closed, though he didn't seem asleep. Shuya
    all of a sudden realized he'd rarely ever heard Shogo's voice, even
    though Shogo had transferred to their school over a month ago.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    glanced at Shogo and then looked at Shuya. Shuya shrugged in response
    and crammed another cookie into his mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    continued chatting with Noriko and Yoshitoki for awhile but...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><br/>
    <br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was almost ten o'clock when Shuya noticed something strange.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    weird was happening inside the bus. Yoshitoki, who was on his left,
    had suddenly fallen asleep and was softly breathing. Shinji Mimura's
    body was slouching into the aisle. Noriko Nakagawa was also asleep.
    No one seemed to be talking. Everyone seemed to be asleep. Well yeah,
    anyone excessively health-conscious might be going to bed now, but
    still, this was their long awaited trip. Wasn't it a bit early to
    fall asleep right after leaving? Why doesn't everyone sing or
    something? Doesn't this bus have one of those atrocious machines
    Shuya hated—karaoke?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Worst
    of all, Shuya himself was overcome with drowsiness. He looked around
    in a daze...then he couldn't even move his head, which felt heavy. He
    slouched against the seat. His eyes drifted through the narrow space
    to the rearview mirror at the center of the large windshield fading
    in the dark___He managed to make out the tiny image of the driver's
    upper body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    driver's face was covered with what appeared to be a mask. A hoselike
    tube extended downward from the mask. Thin straps were wrapped around
    his head, strapped above and below his ears. What was that? Except
    for the hose extending downward, it resembled an airline emergency
    oxygen mask.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>So
    we can't breathe inside this bus? Ladies and gentlemen, this bus will
    be making an emergency landing due to engine trouble. Like, please
    fasten your seat belts, wear your oxygen masks, and follow crew
    member's instructions?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Yeah, right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    heard a scratching sound on the right. Shuya had to struggle to catch
    a glimpse over there. His body felt so heavy. It was as if he were
    immersed in transparent jelly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    Kawada was standing up and struggling to pry open a window. But
    whether it was jammed shut from rust or a broken lock, the window
    refused to budge. Shogo slammed his left fist against the glass. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He's
    trying to break the glass. Why all the fuss?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    the glass didn't break. The fist ready to strike the glass all of a
    sudden went limp and clumsily dropped. His body collapsed into the
    seat. Shuya thought he heard that low voice he'd only recently
    familiarized himself with faintly gasp, &quot;Damn.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Almost
    immediately Shuya fell asleep too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    approximately the same time, students' families in Shiroiwa were
    visited by men in black sedans. Alarmed by the late night visit, the
    parents must have been shocked when the visitors presented them with
    documents stamped with the government's official peach insignia.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    most cases the parents would silently nod as they thought of their
    children whom they most likely would never see again, but there were
    those who frantically protested, in which case they would be knocked
    out by an electroshock baton, or in the worst case, be pummeled by
    fresh bullets spat out from a submachine gun, one step ahead of their
    children in departing from this world.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><br/>
    <br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    then the bus assigned to Shiroiwa Junior High School's Third Year
    Class B's study trip had long since branched off from the rows of
    other buses and taken a U-turn towards the city of Takamatsu. After
    returning to the city it wove its way through various roads before it
    finally stopped and quietly turned off its engine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    man in his forties whose hair was peppered gray looked like a typical
    nice bus driver. Still wearing the oxygen mask that was digging into
    his slightly sagging chin, he turned towards the Class B students
    with a faint look of pity. But as soon as another man appeared under
    the window, his face stiffened. He gave the Republic's idiosyncratic
    salute. Then he pressed the switch to open the door. Shuya glanced
    outside as the masked men in battle gear came rushing in.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Under
    the moonlight, the bluish-white concrete pier gleamed like bone, and
    beyond the pier the ship that would transport &quot;the players&quot;
    was swaying sluggishly in the wide open black sea.</font></font></p>

    a moment Shuya thought he was in a familiar classroom.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    wasn't the usual Third Year Class B classroom of course, but there
    was a lectern, a worn out blackboard, and on the left, a tall stand
    with a large television. There were rows of desks and chairs made of
    plywood glued onto steel tubes. On Shuya's desk someone had carved
    anti-government graffiti into the corner with a pen: &quot;the
    Dictator loves women in uniform.&quot; Then he noticed everyone at
    their desks, the boys clad in buttoned up school uniforms and the
    girls in their sailor suit school uniforms, all forty-one classmates
    who'd only moments ago (at least that's what it felt like) been
    riding the bus together. The only thing was—-either sprawled over
    their desks or slouched back in their seats—they were all
    completely asleep.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From
    beside the frosted window on the side of the hall (assuming this
    building had the same layout as his school), Shuya surveyed the rest
    of the room. He seemed to be the only one awake. In front of him to
    his left and towards the middle of the room was Yoshitoki Kuninobu.
    Behind him was Noriko Nakagawa, and beyond Yoshitoki was Shinji
    Mimura. They were all sprawled on their desks, sleeping deeply.
    Hiroki Sugimura surrendered his large body to his desk (that was when
    it finally dawned on Shuya that the seating assignment was identical
    to the one they had at Shiroiwa Junior High School) by the windows on
    the left side. That was also when he began to realize why the place
    felt odd. The windows beyond Hiroki's body appeared to be covered
    with some kind of black board. Steel sheets? They provided an icy
    reflection of the dull light from the rows of fluorescent lights
    hanging from the ceiling. The frosted glass windows on the side of
    the hall seemed to be draped in black. Maybe they were boarded up
    too. It was impossible to determine the time of day.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at his wristwatch. It read one o'clock. In the morning? In the
    afternoon? The date read &quot;Thurs/22,&quot; which meant that,
    unless someone had tampered with his watch, either three or fifteen
    hours had passed since he had that strange attack of drowsiness. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>All
    right, let's just assume that's the case. Still...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at his classmates.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    felt off. Of course the whole situation was strange. But there was
    something in particular that disturbed him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    immediately realized what it was. Face down on her desk, Noriko had
    above her collar a silver metal band wrapped snugly around her neck.
    Because of his buttoned up collar Yoshitoki Kuninobu's band was
    barely visible, but Shuya managed to see it. Shinji Mimura, Hiroki
    Sugimura, everyone had one on their necks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    the thought occurred to Shuya. He reached for his own neck with his
    right hand.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt something hard and cold. The same thing must have been wrapped
    around his neck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    tugged at it a little but the fit was so tight it refused to budge.
    The moment he became conscious of it, he felt like he was
    suffocating. S</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>teel
    collars! Steel collars as if we're dogs, damn!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    fidgeted with it for a while with his fingers, but then gave up. He
    wondered instead what happened to the study trip? Shuya noticed his
    sports bag sitting by his feet on the floor. Last night he'd casually
    tossed his clothes, towel, school field trip notebook, and a bourbon
    flask into it. Everyone else also had their bags by their feet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    a loud noise erupted from the front entrance, and the door slid open.
    Shuya looked up.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    man came in.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was stocky but well built. His legs were extremely short, as if they
    served as a mere appendage to his torso. He wore light-beige slacks,
    a gray jacket, a red necktie, and black loafers. They all looked worn
    out. A peach-colored badge was pinned to the collar of his jacket,
    indicating his affiliation with the government. His cheeks were rosy.
    What stuck out most though was the man's hairstyle. He wore it down
    to his shoulders like a woman in her prime. It reminded Shuya of the
    grainy Xeroxed tape cover of a Joan Baez tape he'd bought on the
    black market.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    man stood at the lectern and surveyed the classroom. His eyes stopped
    at Shuya, who was the only one awake (assuming this wasn't a dream).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    two stared at each other for at least a full minute. But perhaps
    because the other students were waking up, with their nervous
    breathing gradually spreading through the entire classroom, the man
    looked away from Shuya. Their voices woke up other classmates from
    their deep slumber.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at the rest of the classroom. As they woke up their eyes
    remained out of focus. Everyone was clueless. His eyes met Yoshitoki
    Kuninobu's as his friend turned back. Shuya pointed at his collar,
    tilting his neck slightly. Yoshitoki immediately touched his neck. He
    looked shocked. He shook his head left and right and turned to the
    lectern. Noriko Nakagawa also looked at Shuya with a dazed look.
    Shuya could only shrug in response.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    soon as everyone seemed awake the man spoke up in a cheerful voice,
    &quot;All right, everyone awake? I hope you all slept well!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No
    one replied. Even the class clowns, Yutaka Seto and Yuka Nakagawa
    (Female Student No. 16), were speechless.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >

    the female class representative, Yukie Utsumi, stood up and said, &quot;I
    don't understand what's going on here.&quot; Everyone looked over at
    Yukie. With her long hair neatly braided into a pair of pony tails,
    she looked pretty wound up, but her voice remained assertive.
    Nonetheless, Yukie probably had to delude herself into believing
    they'd been through a traffic accident or some other event that
    caused them all to lose consciousness.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    is terrible. What's going on? I'm scared.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    observing Sakamochi quietly listening to them, Shuya slowly surveyed
    the room. There were several others who remained silent.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    first one he noticed was sitting at an angle behind him in the back
    row in the middle. It was Kazuo Kiriyama. Beneath his slicked-back
    hair his calm eyes were staring at the man at the lectern. His look
    was so calm, it didn't even resemble a glare. He paid no attention to
    his circle of followers addressing him: Ryuhei Sasagawa, Mitsuru
    Numai, Hiroshi Kuronaga (Male Student No. 9), and Sho Tsukioka (Male
    Student No. 14).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    there was Mitsuko Souma, sitting in the second row by the window. She
    was the one who looked jaded. Her seat was separated from the rest of
    her &quot;group,&quot; which consisted of Hirono Shimizu and Yoshimi
    Yahagi. Of course none of the other girls, nor boys for that matter,
    would even attempt to talk to her. (On Shuya's left, Hirono and
    Yoshimi were speaking to each other.) Even though Mitsuko had the
    gorgeous looks of a pop idol, she always wore a strange, listless
    expression on her face. She stared at Sakamochi with her arms folded.
    (Hiroki Sugimura sat right behind her, talking to Tadakatsu
    Hatagami.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    Kawada sat at the second to last row by the window. He was also
    silently staring at Sakamochi. But he took out a piece of gum, then
    began chewing it, continuing to stare at the teacher as his jaw
    moved.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked to the front of the class. Noriko Nakagawa was still staring
    back at him. Her dark eyes were trembling nervously. Shuya glanced
    over at Yoshitoki, who was sitting in front of her, but Yoshitoki was
    busy talking to Shinji Mimura. Shuya immediately glanced back at
    Noriko, tucked his chin in slightly, and nodded. It seemed to have a
    calming effect on her. Her eyes seemed to relax a little.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right, all right, please be quiet.&quot; Sakamochi clapped his hands
    together several times to get their attention. The clamor suddenly
    subsided. &quot;Let me explain the situation. The reason why you're
    all here today then...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he said: &quot;...is to kill each other.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    no one responded. Everyone remained frozen, like figures in a still
    photograph. But—Shuya noticed—Shogo continued chewing his gum.
    His expression hadn't changed. But Shuya thought he'd caught a
    glimpse of a faint grin flash across his face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    continued smiling and resumed, &quot;Your class has been selected for

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    first heard about the Program before becoming a fourth grader. It was
    when he finally got used to the Charity House, where he was brought
    by a friend of his parents after both of them died in a traffic
    accident. (All his relatives had refused to take him in. He heard it
    was because his parents had been involved in anti-government
    activities, but he never confirmed this story.) Shuya thought it was
    when he was five. He was watching television in the play room with
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu, who'd been at the Charity House before Shuya. His
    favorite robot anime show had just ended and the current
    superintendent of the institution, Ms. Ryoko Anno (the daughter of
    the former superintendent; at the time she was probably still a high
    school student, but everyone who worked there was called Mr., Mrs.,
    or Ms.) switched the channel. Shuya was just gazing at the screen,
    but as soon as he saw the man in a stiff suit addressing him, he
    realized it was only that boring show called &quot;The News,&quot;
    the program they showed on every channel at various times.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    man was reading from his script. Shuya couldn't remember exactly what
    he said but it was always the same and probably went something like
    this:</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    have received a report from the Special Defense Forces and the
    government that the Program in Kagawa Prefecture ended yesterday at
    3:12 p.m. It has been three years since the last Program was
    conducted here. The subject class was Third Year E Class from
    Zentsuji No. 4 Junior High School. The undisclosed location was
    Shidakajima Island, four kilometers away from Tadotsu-cho. The winner
    emerged after 3 days, 7 hours, and 43 minutes. Furthermore, with the
    retrieval of the corpses and autopsies conducted today, the causes of
    deaths for all 38 students killed have been determined: 17 from
    gunshot wounds, 9 from knife or blade wounds, 5 from blunt weapons,
    and 3 choked to death...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An
    image of what appeared to be &quot;the winner,&quot; a girl clad in a
    tattered sailor suit uniform came on the screen. Pressed between two
    Special Defense Forces soldiers, she looked back at the camera, her
    face&nbsp;twitching. Under her long messy hair, some dark red
    substance stuck to her right temple. Shuya could still clearly recall
    how her twitching face occasionally formed what appeared to be,
    strangely enough, a smile.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    realized now that this was the first time he had seen an insane
    person. But at the time he had no idea what was wrong with her. He
    only felt inexplicably afraid, as if he'd seen a ghost.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    believed he had asked, &quot;What is this, Ms. Anno?&quot; Ms. Anno
    only shook her head and replied, &quot;Oh it's nothing.&quot; Ms.
    Anno turned away from Shuya slightly and whispered, &quot;Poor girl.&quot;
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu had already stopped watching a while ago and was
    preoccupied with eating his tangerine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Shuya grew older, this same local report, given at the rate of once
    every two years at any time without any warning, felt more and more
    ominous. From a pool of all third-year junior high school students,
    fifty classes were issued an annual guaranteed death sentence. That
    was two thousand students if each class consisted of forty students,
    no, more accurately, that was 1,950 students killed. Worse yet, it
    wasn't simply a mass execution. The students had to kill each other,
    competing for the throne of survivor. It was the most terrifying
    version of musical chairs imaginable.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    it was impossible to oppose the Program. It was impossible to protest
    anything the Republic of Greater East Asia did.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    Shuya decided to give in. That was how most of the third-year
    &quot;reserves&quot; from junior high school dealt with it, right?
    Okay, our special conscription system? The beautiful homeland of
    Vigorous Rice Plants? How many junior highs were there in the
    republic? The birth rate might be declining but your chances were
    still less than one in eight hundred. In Kagawa Prefecture that meant
    only one class every other year would be &quot;chosen.&quot; Put
    bluntly, you were just as likely to die in a traffic accident. Given
    how Shuya never had the luck of the draw, he figured he wouldn't be
    chosen. Even in the local raffle he'd never win more than a box of
    tissues. So he'd never be chosen. So fuck off, man.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then sometimes when he heard someone in class, particularly a girl in
    tears, saying something like, &quot;My cousin was in the Program
    and...&quot; that dark fear choked him up again. He was angry too. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    mean, who had the right to terrify that poor girl?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    within a matter of days the same girl who'd been so gloomy would
    begin smiling. And Shuya's fear and anger would gradually wane and
    disappear too. But the vague distrust and powerlessness he felt
    towards the government nonetheless remained.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That's
    the way things went.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    when Shuya entered his third year in junior high school this year, he
    along with his other classmates assumed they would be safe. Actually
    they really had no choice but to assume this.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Until
    now.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    can't be.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    chair fell as someone stood up. The voice was shrill enough to make
    Shuya glance over at the desk behind Hiroki Sugimura. It was Kyoichi
    Motobuchi, who was the male class representative. His face was beyond
    pale. It had turned gray, providing a surreal contrast to his silver
    framed glasses, resembling one of those silkscreen prints by Andy
    Warhol illustrated in their art textbooks as &quot;the decadent art
    of American imperialists.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some
    of his classmates might have been hoping that Kyoichi would provide
    some adequate rational form of protest. Kill the friends you were
    hanging out with yesterday? It was impossible. Someone's making
    a&nbsp;mistake here. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hey
    rep, can you take care of this one for us?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Kyoichi completely let them down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;M-my
    father is a director of environmental affairs in the prefectural
    government. How could the class I'm in be selected for th-the
    Program?...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Due
    to his shaking, his tense voice sounded even more wound up than
    usual.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    man who called himself Sakamochi grinned and shook his head, his long
    hair swinging in the air. &quot;Let's see. You're Kyoichi Motobuchi,
    right?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    must know what equality means. Listen up. All people are born equal.
    Your father's job in the prefectural government doesn't entitle you
    to special privileges. You are no different. Listen up, everybody.
    You all have your own distinct personal backgrounds. Of course some
    of you come from rich families, some from poor families. But
    circumstances beyond your control like that shouldn't determine who
    you are. You must all realize what you're worth on your own. So
    Kyoichi, let's not delude ourselves that you're somehow
    special—because you're not!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    bawled this out so suddenly, Kyoichi fell back into this seat.
    Sakamochi glared at Kyoichi for a while, but then his smile returned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Your
    class will be mentioned in today's morning news. Of course because
    the Program must be conducted in secret, the details will remain
    undisclosed until the game ends. Now let's see, oh right, your
    parents have already been notified.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everyone
    still seemed lost in a daze. Classmates slaughtering each other?
    Impossible.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    still don't believe this is happening, do you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    scratched his head with a troubled look. Then he turned to the
    entrance and called out, &quot;I need you guys to come in!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    response the door slid open and three men came rushing in. They were
    all wearing camouflage fatigues and combat boots and tucked under
    their arms steel helmets bearing the peach insignia. It was
    immediately obvious they were Special Defense Forces soldiers. They
    had assault rifles strapped over their shoulders, and Shuya could see
    automatic pistols holstered onto their belts. One of the soldiers was
    tall with strangely kinked hair, giving the impression of someone
    frivolous, the other was medium height, with a handsome,
    boyish-looking face, and the last one wore a slight grin, but was
    eclipsed by the charisma of the other two. They were carrying a
    large, thick nylon sack resembling a black sleeping bag. Various
    parts of the bag poked up as if it were stuffed with pineapples.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    stood by the window and the three men placed the bag on the lectern.
    Both sides of the bag protruded over the lectern, particularly the
    side facing the window, and dangled down, perhaps because the
    contents inside were soft.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    announced, &quot;Let me introduce these men who will be assisting you
    for the Program. Mr. Tahara, Mr. Kondo, and Mr. Nomura. Now why don't
    you show them what's inside?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    frivolous one, Tahara, approached the lectern from the side of the
    hall, placed his hand on the zipper, and pulled the bag open.
    Something drenched in red liquid...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;AIEEEEE!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    it was fully open, one of the girls in the front row screamed and was
    immediately followed by the others. As the desks and chairs made a
    clattering sound, other voices asked, &quot;Whaaat?&quot; and a
    soprano chorus swelled up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    held his breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    could see the body of the teacher in charge of Class B, Masao
    Hayashida, inside the half open bag. No, he was now their former
    teacher. Or in fact he was now the former Mr. Hayashida.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    flimsy blue-gray suit was drenched in blood. Only half of his large
    black glasses that earned him the nickname &quot;Dragonfly&quot;
    remained. What could you expect, only the left half of his head
    remained. Underneath the remaining lens the marblelike, crimson
    eyeball gazed absently at the ceiling. Gray jelly, what must have
    been his brains, clung to his remaining hair. As if relieved to be
    released, his left arm, still wearing a watch, poked out of the bag,
    dangling in front of the lectern. The ones sitting in front might
    have actually seen the second hand ticking away.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right, all right, all right, quiet now. Be quiet. Silence!&quot;
    Sakamochi clapped his hands, but the girls' shrieking wouldn't
    subside.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    the boyish looking soldier named Kondo pulled out his pistol.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    expected a warning shot into the ceiling, but the soldier instead
    grabbed the bag containing Hayashida with one of his hands, and
    dragged the bag down from the lectern. He snapped Hayashida's head up
    to his face. He looked like a hero in a sci-fi flick fighting a giant
    bagworm.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    soldier pumped two bullets into Mr. Hayashida's head. The rest of
    Hayashida's head flew apart. The high powered bullets tore apart his
    brains and bones which formed a bloody mist and splattered all over
    the faces and chests of the students in the front row.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    echoes from the gunfire subsided. There was hardly any trace of
    Hayashida's head. The soldier tossed Hayashida's body to the side of
    the lectern. No one was screaming.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most
    of the standing students timidly returned to their seats. The
    uncharismatic soldier on the far side dragged the bag containing
    Hayashida's body to the corner of the classroom, then joined the
    other two standing by the lectern. Sakamochi returned to his position
    behind the lectern.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    again the room turned silent, but that silence was soon broken by the
    sound of someone groaning in the back, followed by the damp splash of
    vomit splattering against the floor. Shuya could smell it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Listen
    up everyone. As you can see, Mr. Hayashida vehemently opposed your
    class' assignment to the Program,&quot; Sakamochi said, scratching
    his hair. &quot;Well, it was all so sudden, we do feel bad about it,
    but...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    room grew silent again. Everyone now knew. This was real. It was no
    mistake, nor was it a prank. They were going to be forced to kill
    each other.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    desperately tried to think clearly. The unreal situation had put him
    in a daze. His mind was spinning from the horrible corpse of
    Hayashida and the role it played in this horror show.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    had to escape. But how?...first he'd meet with Yoshitoki...Shinji and
    Hiroki...but how was the Program actually conducted? The details were
    never publicized. Students were given weapons to kill each other.
    That much was known. But could they talk to each other? How did the
    government monitor the game?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I...I...&quot;
    Shuya's thoughts were interrupted. He looked up and opened his eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    Kuninobu half rose and gazed at Sakamochi, unsure, it seemed, whether
    he should continue. He looked as if his words were beyond his
    control. Shuya's body tensed up. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Don't
    provoke them, Yoshitoki!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeeees?
    What is it? You can ask me anything.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    offered a friendly smile, and like a puppet Yoshitoki continued,
    &quot;I...don't have parents. So who did you contact?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ah
    ha,&quot; Sakamochi nodded. &quot;I remember there was someone from
    one of the welfare institutions. So you must be Shuya Nanahara? Let's
    see, according to the school report you were the one with dangerous
    ideas. So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    Shuya,&quot; Shuya interrupted, raising his voice. Sakamochi glanced
    at Shuya and then back at Yoshitoki. Still in a daze, Yoshitoki
    glanced back at Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    that's right. I'm so sorry. There was one more. So you must be
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu. Well, I contacted the superintendent of the
    institution where you were both raised. Yes...she was very pretty,&quot;
    Sakamochi said and grinned. While his smile appeared to be cheerful,
    there was something disturbing about it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    face tensed up. &quot;What the hell did you do to Ms. Anno?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    like Mr. Hayashida, she was very uncooperative. They both didn't
    accept your assignment, so in order to silence her, well, I had
    to...&quot; Sakamochi continued calmly, &quot;...rape her. Oh, don't
    worry. It's not like she's dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    flushed red with anger and leaped up, but before he could say
    anything, Yoshitoki said, &quot;I'll kill you!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    was standing up. His expression had changed, though. He'd always been
    so friendly to everyone. No matter what happened, it was impossible
    to imagine him getting angry. His expression now was something he
    saved for those rare times he was truly enraged. No one else in class
    might have ever seen him like this, but Shuya had seen him this upset
    twice. The first time was when they were fourth graders and a car ran
    over the Charity House's pet dog, Eddie, right in front of the gate.
    Frantically, Yoshitoki chased after the fleeing car. The second time
    was only a year ago, when a man had been using the school's debt as
    leverage to come on to Ms. Anno. After she managed to pay back the
    money, and thereby rejected his advances, the man cursed her out
    right in front of them, as if he wanted all the Charity House's
    residents to hear him. If Shuya hadn't stopped Yoshitoki, the man
    would have lost his front teeth, though Yoshitoki would have also
    been severely injured. Yoshitoki was extremely kind, and even when he
    was insulted or picked on he usually laughed it off. But when someone
    he truly loved was hurt, his response was extreme. This was something
    Shuya admired about Yoshitoki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    kill you, you bastard!&quot; Yoshitoki continued, screaming, &quot;I'll
    kill you and dump you into a pile of shit!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hmm.&quot;
    Sakamochi looked amused. &quot;Are you serious, Yoshitoki? You know
    one must be responsible&nbsp;for the things one says.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Give
    me a break! I'm going to kill you! Don't you forget it!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it, Yoshitoki! Stop it!&quot;&nbsp;Yoshitoki paid no attention to
    Shuya's screaming.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    spoke in a strange, kind voice, as if to appease Yoshitoki.&nbsp;&quot;Look,
    Yoshitoki. What you're doing right now is voicing your opposition to
    the government.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    kill you!&quot; Yoshitoki didn't stop. &quot;I'll kill you I'll kill
    you I'll kill you!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    could no longer contain himself and right when he was about to scream
    again, Sakamochi shook his head and waved his hand at the three
    Special Defense Forces soldiers standing by the lectern.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    resembled a chorus group, like the Four Freshmen. The men in
    fatigues, Tahara, Kondo, and Nomura, all lifted their right hands in
    a dramatic, emotionally charged pose. But their hands were holding
    guns. Now the chorus would have been something like, &quot;Baby
    please, baby please, spend this night with me—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    saw Yoshitoki's bulging eyes open even wider.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    three automatic pistols exploded all at once. Just as he was stepping
    out into the aisle, Yoshitoki's body shook as if dancing the
    boogaloo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    happened so quickly that Noriko Nakagawa, who sat right behind
    Yoshitoki, along with the rest of the class, didn't even have time to
    duck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    gunshot sounds hadn't even died down before Yoshitoki slowly tipped
    over to the right and crashed in between his desk and Izumi Kanai's
    on the right. Izumi shrieked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    threesome stood with their right hands extended. Thin smoke from each
    of their barrels simultaneously trailed upward. Shuya then saw in
    between the legs of the desk the familiar face turned towards him.
    The bulging eyes remained open, fixed on a point on the floor. A
    bright puddle of blood began oozing out onto the floor. Yoshitoki's
    right shoulder began twitching down to his fingers.</font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stood up to run to him, but Noriko Nakagawa, who was sitting closer,
    was quicker. &quot;Yoshitoki!&quot; she screamed and crouched down
    beside him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    Tahara, the frivolous one, aimed his gun at Noriko and pulled the
    trigger. Noriko tumbled forward as if she were swept off her feet and
    collapsed on top of Yoshitoki, who continued to twitch.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tahara
    immediately pointed his gun at Shuya. Shuya's mind was racing now but
    his body was frozen. Only his eyes moved. He saw the blood spurting
    out of Noriko's calf.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    said to Noriko, &quot;You will not leave your desk without my
    permission.&quot; Then he looked over at Shuya, saying, &quot;The
    same applies to you, Shuya. Now sit down.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    did his best to take his eyes away from Noriko's bloody leg and
    Yoshitoki underneath her. He looked Sakamochi directly in the eye.
    His neck muscles had tensed up from the shock of the scene.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    the hell is going on here!?&quot; Tahara still pointed his gun at his
    forehead. Shuya remained still, bursting out, &quot;What the hell are
    you doing!? We have to get some help for Yoshitoki...and Noriko...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    grimaced and shook his head. Then he repeated, &quot;Forget about it
    and sit down. You too, Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko,
    completely pale from looking at Yoshitoki lying underneath her,
    slowly looked up at Sakamochi. She seemed overwhelmed with anger more
    than she was with the pain she must have been suffering from. She
    raised her eyes and glared back at Sakamochi. &quot;Please get some
    help.&quot; She spoke each word deliberately. &quot;For Yoshitoki.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki's
    right arm continued to twitch. But while they watched over him the
    twitching subsided. It was evident his injury would be fatal unless
    he was treated immediately.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    sighed deeply, then addressed the frivolous one, &quot;Then Mr.
    Tahara, will you please take care of this.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    they could figure out what he meant, Tahara pointed his gun downward
    and pulled the trigger. BLAMM. Yoshitoki Kuninobu's head bounced up
    once, then something from his head splashed onto Noriko's face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dumbstruck,
    Noriko's mouth hung open. Her face was covered with a dark red
    substance.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized his mouth was hanging open too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    part of his head had been blown away, Yoshitoki's eyes still remained
    focused on the same part of the floor. He was no longer twitching,
    though. He was motionless.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;See?&quot;
    Sakamochi said. &quot;He was already dying. Now then, please return
    to your seats.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh...&quot;
    Noriko looked down at Yoshitoki's deformed head, &quot;...my...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was also stunned. His eyes were glued to Yoshitoki's face, lying
    between the legs of the desk. His thoughts were completely paralyzed,
    as if his own brains had been blown to bits. Memories of Yoshitoki
    flashed through his dazed mind. The little adventures they took,
    camping or walking down the river, a rainy day spent playing an old
    board game, mimicking &quot;Jake and Elwood,&quot; the heroes who,
    like themselves, were orphans in the American movie </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
    Blues Brothers</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    (amazingly, it was a dubbed version, although the voice actors were
    horrible), which had become a blackmarket hit, and then just
    recently, Yoshitoki's face when he said, &quot; Hey Shuya, I got a
    crush on someone.&quot; And then...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you two deaf?&quot; Sakamochi repeated. Yes, Shuya was deaf to his
    words. He just stared at Yoshitoki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    was no different. If they hadn't moved, they would have followed in
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu's footsteps. Right beside Sakamochi, Tahara
    pointed his gun at Noriko, while the other two pointed theirs at
    Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    it was thanks to a calm, in fact light-hearted voice calling out,
    &quot;M-m-m-mister Sakamochi,&quot; that Shuya was brought back to
    his senses, at least enough to gaze numbly at the caller.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Beyond
    Yoshitoki's empty seat, Shinji Mimura had his hand raised. Noriko
    slowly looked at him too.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hm?
    Let's see. You must be Shinji Mimura. What is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    put his hand down and spoke, &quot;Noriko looks injured. I was
    wondering if I could help her get back to her seat.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Despite
    the extremity of their situation, Shinji spoke in the usual voice of
    The Third Man.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    raised his brow slightly, but then nodded.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right, go ahead. I really want to get things moving.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    nodded, stood up, and walked towards Noriko. As he approached her, he
    took out a neatly folded handkerchief out of his pocket and leaned
    between Yoshitoki's corpse and Noriko. He first wiped Noriko's face,
    which was covered with Yoshitoki's blood. Noriko hardly reacted. Then
    he said, &quot;Stand up, Noriko,&quot; and put his hand under
    Noriko's right arm to help her get up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then,
    with his back facing Sakamochi, Shinji looked at Shuya, who remained
    half-standing. Under his sharp, well defined brows, his eyes which
    always had a mildly amused look were now dead serious. He raised his
    right brow and moved his chin, shaking his head slightly. His left
    hand pushed down, as if he were making a pressing motion. Shuya
    didn't understand this signal. Shinji made the same move again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    he was still dazed, Shuya finally understood that Shinji was telling
    him to calm down. He looked back at Shinji...and slowly eased his way
    back into his seat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    nodded. After returning Noriko to her seat, he turned around and
    returned to his seat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    sat down. Blood poured out of the wound in her right leg dangling
    from her seat. Her white socks and sneakers were soaked in red, as if
    she were wearing Santa Claus boots, but only on her right foot.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    was coming to her senses a little too. She seemed to be making a
    gesture to thank Shinji. But as if he could see out the back of his
    head Shinji shrugged his shoulders to stop her. Noriko withdrew and
    saw once again Yoshitoki's body lying below her right hand. She
    stared at him without a word but her eyes seemed to be brimming with
    tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    also looked again at the corpse, his view partly obscured by the
    desks. Yes, it was a corpse. There was no doubt about it. It was hard
    to comprehend, but Yoshitoki had become a corpse, the corpse of
    someone with whom he had shared ten years of his life.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he looked at Yoshitoki's gaping eyes, Shuya's anger became more
    pronounced and clear, like a throbbing pulse. The anger rushed
    through his entire body so powerfully that it almost made him shake.
    His feelings, which had been muted by the initial shock, were
    beginning to surface. Shuya turned and bared his teeth towards
    Sakamochi.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    looked amused by Shuya. Shuya would never forgive him for this. He
    was going to kill the bastard.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had been on the verge of blowing up the way Yoshitoki did. But
    then...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    Mimura had intervened at the crucial moment, telling him to calm
    down. Shuya immediately recalled how he got the signal from him only
    moments ago. Of course if he blew up now he would end up like
    Yoshitoki. And more importantly...now the girl whom Yoshitoki adored
    so much was severely injured. If he were to die now...what would
    happen to Noriko Nakagawa?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    tried his best to tear his eyes away from Sakamochi. He looked down
    at his desktop. He felt wretched, as if his heart were being crushed
    from anger and sadness that had no outlet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    quietly laughed. He looked away from Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    clenched both of his fists tightly under the desk in order to calm
    down his body which was shaking uncontrollably. He clenched them
    tighter and tighter. It was no easy feat to control his emotions
    though, with Yoshitoki's corpse lying right in front of him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    was incomprehensible. How could it be? How could you lose
    someone...someone so close?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Yoshitoki

    result? We both felt really bad about that. Or when we fought for
    that dog Eddie's attention? Or when we pulled a prank in school and
    ended up hiding in the faculty room attic? We almost got caught, but
    after we managed to escape, we had a good laugh___Yoshitoki and I

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    raised his hand again, &quot;I have another question, Mr. Sakamochi.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    again? What is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko
    is injured. I understand we will be participating in the Program, but
    doesn't this make the game unfair?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    looked amused.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    perhaps, yes. So what is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Which
    means she should be treated, which means the Program should be
    postponed until her recovery, no?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had barely managed to hold back his anger, so he was amazed by the
    contrast in Shinji Mimura's calm conduct. It was a bit strange that
    Shuya could actually afford to be impressed. Yes, Shinji Mimura was a
    lot calmer than Shuya. Shinji was right. If Shinji's request was
    granted, that might buy them some extra time. Then they might be able
    to escape.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi's
    face contorted into laughter. &quot;That's a very interesting
    suggestion, Shinji.&quot;&nbsp;Sakamochi instead offered an
    alternative solution, &quot;Then shall we kill Noriko Nakagawa now,
    and make the game equal?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    herself along with the rest of class suddenly froze up again. Shuya
    could see Shinji's back underneath his school uniform stiffen as he
    immediately responded, &quot;I take it back, I take it back. Come on,
    I was just kidding.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    burst out laughing again at Shinji's humorous tone. Tahara, whose
    right hand had been on his holster, quickly returned it to the strap
    of his rifle hanging off his shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    clapped his hands again.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right then, listen up. First of all, each and every one of you differ
    according to your intelligence,&nbsp;physical dexterity, etc., etc.
    We're born unequal. So we will not treat Noriko Nakagawa—over
    there!! No whispering!&quot; Sakamochi suddenly yelled. He threw a
    white object where Fumiyo Fujiyoshi (Female Student No. 18) was in
    the process of whispering something to the female class
    representative Yukie Utsumi, who was sitting next to her. Shuya
    wondered whether it was chalk for a moment, but of course that was
    absurd, given the circumstances.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    object made the thumping sound of a nail being pounded into a coffin.
    A thin knife was planted in the middle of Fumiyo Fujiyoshi's wide,
    fair-skinned forehead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    stared at the sight, her eyes open wide. A stranger sight though was
    Fumiyo herself raising her eyes, struggling to locate the knife
    planted in her forehead. Her head arched back in this attempt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she collapsed to the side. As she fell, her left temple hit the
    corner of Yukie's desk and nudged it.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    there was no room for doubt. Who could survive a knife planted in
    one's forehead?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No
    one moved. No one spoke a word. Yukie took a deep breath and stared
    down at Fumiyo. Noriko was also gazing at her. Shinji Mimura kept his
    lips pursed as he looked at Fumiyo collapsed between the desks just
    like Yoshitoki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    throat dry, Shuya held his breath and thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>&quot;He
    did that on a whim! A whim! Damn it! Our lives are totally at the
    mercy of this asshole Sakamochi!&quot;</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oops,
    I did it. I'm so sorry. The instructor killing someone, that's
    against the rules, huh?&quot; Sakamochi closed his eyes and scratched
    his head. But his face became serious again and he said, &quot;I need
    your undivided attention. Impulsive actions are strictly prohibited.
    That means whispering will not be permitted. It's hard on me but if
    you whisper, I'll toss another knife at you!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    clenched his teeth. He told himself to be patient and repeated this
    over and over to himself while two classmates were sprawled dead on
    the floor.&nbsp;Still, he was drawn to Yoshitoki's face and couldn't
    help but look at him. He felt he was about to cry.</font></font></p>

    returned to his cheerful voice. The classroom began to reek of

    that of the dried blood of their instructor, &quot;Dragonfly&quot;
    Hayashida. Shuya couldn't see Fumiyo Fujiyoshi's face from his seat,

    Sakamochi wore a wide grin, &quot;the last remaining survivor can go
    home. You even get a nice card autographed by the Dictator. Isn't
    that wonderful?&quot;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Now
    you may think this is a horrible game. But in life the unexpected is
    bound to happen. You must at all times maintain self-control in order
    to respond properly to accidents. Consider this an exercise then.
    Also, men and women will be treated equally. There will be no
    handicaps for either side. I do have good news for the girls, though.
    According to Program statistics, 49% of past winning survivors have
    been&nbsp;girls. The motto here is, 'I'm just like the others and the
    others are like me.' There is nothing to be afraid of.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    made a signal. The camouflaged trio went into the hall and began to
    haul in the large, black, nylon day packs. The packs formed a pile
    right beside the body bag of Mr. Hayashida. Some of them were
    lopsided, as if they might contain a pole-shaped object inside trying
    to poke out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    will have you leave one by one. Each one of you will take one of
    these bags prior to departure. Each pack contains food, water, and a
    weapon. Let's see, as I said, every one of you differs according to
    ability. So these weapons will add another random element. Well, that
    sounds complicated. In other words, it will make the game all the
    more unpredictable. You will each end up with a randomly selected
    weapon. As you leave in order, you will take the pack on top of the
    pile. Each pack also contains a map of the island, a compass, and a
    watch. Are there any of you who don't have watches? You all do? Oh, I
    forgot to mention this, but we are on an island with an approximate
    circumference of six kilometers. Its never been used for the Program.
    We had the residents evacuate the island. So there is absolutely no
    one else here. So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    faced the blackboard and grabbed a piece of chalk. He drew a rough
    diamond shape next to where he had written his name, &quot;Kinpatsu
    Sakamochi.&quot; On the top-right he drew an arrow pointing upward
    and the letter &quot;</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>N</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.&quot;
    He wrote an &quot;X&quot; inside the diamond, right of its center.
    With the chalk still pressed against the blackboard, he turned
    towards the students.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right then. We're in the school on this island. This is a diagram of
    the island, so this indicates the school. Got that?&quot; Sakamochi
    tapped the symbol with his chalk. &quot;I'm going to be staying here.
    I'll be overlooking your efforts.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    then drew four spindle shapes scattered to the north, south, east,
    and west sides of the diamond.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;These
    are ships. They are there to kill anyone attempting to escape by
    sea.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he drew parallel vertical and horizontal lines over the island. The
    diamond shape indicating the island resembled a warped grill now.
    Starting from the top-left, Sakamochi wrote markers in each grid,
    &quot;A=l,&quot; &quot;A=2,&quot;...in order. The next row read,
    &quot;B=l,&quot; &quot;B=2,&quot; etc.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    is just a simplified diagram. The map inside your packs will look
    something like this.&quot; Sakamochi placed his chalk down and
    clapped his hands to clear off the dust.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Once
    you leave the premises, you are free to go anywhere. However,
    announcements will be made across the entire island at the hours of
    twelve and six, in the morning and at night. That's four a day. I'll
    be referring to this map when I announce the location of zones that
    will be forbidden after a certain time. You must examine your maps
    closely and check your compasses against them. If you are in a
    forbidden zone you must clear out of the area as soon as possible.
    Because...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    put his hands on the lectern and looked at everyone.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;...of
    the collars around your necks.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Until
    he had made this remark, several students had failed to notice the
    collars. They touched their necks and looked shocked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    device is the result of the latest technology developed by our
    Republic. It is 100% waterproof, antishock, and uh-uh, no, no, it
    can't come off. It won't come off. If you try to pry it loose...&quot;
    Sakamochi&nbsp;took a small breath, &quot;...it will explode.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Several
    students who had been fingering their collars immediately released
    their hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    grinned. &quot;The collar monitors your pulse in order to verify
    signs of life and transmits this information to the mainframe at this
    school. It also pinpoints your exact position on the island for us.
    Now, let's return to the map.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    swung his right arm back and pointed to the map on the blackboard.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    same computer will also randomly select forbidden zones. And if there
    are any students left in the zone after the designated time—of
    course dead students won't matter—the computer will automatically
    detect anyone alive and immediately send a signal to his or her
    collar. Then...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knew what he would say.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    collar will explode.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    paused for a moment to examine everyone. Then he continued, &quot;Why
    would we do this? Because if everyone huddled up together in one
    spot, the game wouldn't proceed. So we will make you move.
    Simultaneously, the area you can move around in will shrink. Got
    that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    called it a game. No wonder. It was fucking outrageous. No one said a
    word but everyone appeared to understand the rules.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right, so that means hiding in a building will do you no good. Even
    if you hide in some hole you dug in the ground the transmission will
    reach you. Oh and by the way, you are free to hide in any building
    but you won't be able to use the phone. You won't be able to contact
    your parents. You have to fight on your own alone. But that's how the
    game of life is anyway. Now I did say that the game will begin
    without any forbidden zones, but there is one exception: this school.
    Twenty minutes after your departure this school will become a
    forbidden zone. So please first get out of this area. Let's see, you
    must be two hundred meters away. Got that? Now, in my announcements I
    will also read off the names of those who have died in the past six
    hours. Each announcement will be made regularly at six-hour
    intervals, but I'll also be contacting the last remaining survivor by
    announcement as well. Oh...and one more thing. There is a time limit.
    Listen up. A time limit. A lot of people die in the Program, but if
    no one dies within twenty-four hours then your time's expired, and it
    won't matter how many students are left....&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knew what he would say.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    computer will detonate the collars of the remaining students. There
    will be no winner.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Again
    he was right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    stopped speaking. The entire classroom had become silent. The room
    was still reeking with the heavy stench of Yoshitoki Kuninobu's
    blood. Everyone remained in their collective daze. They were scared,
    but this situation, where they were about to be thrown into a killing
    game, seemed beyond their comprehension.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if responding to their general state of mind, Sakamochi clapped his
    hands. &quot;Well, I've covered all the tedious details. Now I have
    something more important to tell you. A piece of advice. Some of you
    might be thinking that murdering your classmates is impossible. But
    don't forget there are others willing to do it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wanted to scream, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>you're
    full of it!</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    But with the Fumiyo-Fujiyoshi-executed-for-whispering incident only
    moments in the past he could only stay put.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everybody
    remained silent, but something had suddenly changed and Shuya knew
    it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everyone
    was looking around, glancing at the others' pale faces. Whenever
    anyone's gaze met, their eyes would nervously turn toward Sakamochi.
    It only happened within a matter of seconds, but their expressions
    were exactly the same: they were tense and suspicious, wondering who
    was already ready to take part. Only a few, like Shinji Mimura,
    remained calm.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    clenched his teeth again. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>You're
    falling into their trap! Think about it, we're a group. There's no
    way we can kill each other!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right then, I need to make sure you get my point. You'll find some
    paper and pencils in your desks.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everyone
    timidly took out their paper and pencils. Shuya had no choice but to
    follow his instructions.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Now
    then, I want you to write this down. To memorize something, it's best
    to write it down. Write this. 'We will kill each other.' Write it
    three times.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    heard the pencils scribbling against the paper. Noriko too held her
    pencil, looking morose. While Shuya wrote out this insane motto, he
    glanced at Yoshitoki's body, which remained lying between the desks.
    He recalled Yoshitoki's warm smile.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    continued, &quot;Okay then. 'If I don't kill, I will be killed.'
    Write this down three times too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    also glanced over at Fumiyo Fujiyoshi. Her white fingers poking out
    of the cuffs of her sailor suit uniform gently formed a bowl. She was
    the nurse's aide. She was quiet but very caring.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he looked up at Sakamochi.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    then, let's see, every two minutes one of you will be leaving the
    classroom. Once you go through this door and turn right down the hall
    you'll find the school exit. You are to leave immediately. Anyone
    loitering in the hall will be immediately shot. Now, who do we start
    with? According to the Program rules, once we determine the first
    person, the rest of the order will correspond to your classroom
    seating assignments. Male, female, male, female, got it? Once we
    reach the last seat number, we start over from the first number.
    So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    this point, Shuya recalled that Noriko's seating number was 15. It
    was the same as his. Which meant that he and Noriko could leave
    almost simultaneously (unless she was chosen first, which meant he
    would be the last one to leave).&nbsp;But...could Noriko walk?&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    took out an envelope from his inner coat pocket.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    first student is selected by lottery. Hold on a second...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From
    his pocket Sakamochi produced a pink-ribboned pair of scissors and
    ceremoniously cut open the end of the envelope.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when Kazuo Kiriyama spoke up. Like Shinji Mimura, he also sounded
    calm. But his voice sounded cold with a harsh ring. &quot;I was
    wondering when the game begins.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everyone
    looked back to the last row, where Kiriyama was sitting. (Shogo
    Kawada was the only who didn't turn. He just continued to chew his
    gum.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    gestured with his hand, &quot;As soon as you leave here. So you all
    might want to hide out to cook up your own strategies...since it's
    night right now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    Kiriyama didn't respond. Shuya finally confirmed it was midnight, or
    1 a.m.—no, it was already near 1:30 a.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    cutting open the envelope Sakamochi pulled out from it a white sheet
    of paper, and he unfolded it. His mouth formed an &quot;O&quot; and
    he remarked, &quot;What a coincidence! It's student No. 1. Yoshio
    Akamatsu.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hearing
    the announcement, Yoshio Akamatsu, who sat at the front row of the
    column near the windows (steel plates), looked shaken. He was 180
    centimeters tall, weighing 90 kilograms, so he was large, but he
    couldn't even catch a fly ball, nor could he run a full lap around
    the track. Yoshio was always bumbling through gym class. Now his lips
    were pale blue.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hurry
    up, Yoshio Akamatsu,&quot; Sakamochi said. Yoshio held the bag he'd
    packed for the study trip and staggered to his feet. He made his way
    forward and received his day pack from the camouflaged trio, who now
    held their rifles at their waists. He stood at the open door and
    faced the darkness. He looked back at everyone with a terrified face,
    but then a moment later he vanished beyond the door. Two or three
    footsteps turned into the pounding sound of his running, which then
    faded away. It sounded like he fell once but then it sounded like he
    dashed off again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the quiet room several students took a deep, restrained breath.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Now
    we will wait two minutes. Then the next one will be Female Student
    No. 1, Mizuho Inada—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    routine continued ruthlessly on and on like this.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    there was something Shuya noticed when Female Student No. 4 Sakura
    Ogawa got up to leave. Sakura sat two seats behind Shuya, in the very
    last row. As she made her way to the exit, she touched the desk of
    her boyfriend Kazuhiko Yamamoto and left a piece of paper behind for
    him. She might have dashed off a message on that sheet of paper on
    which they'd been instructed to write, &quot;We will kill each
    other.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    might have been the only one who saw this. At the very least
    Sakamochi didn't seem to notice. Kazuhiko snatched the scrap of paper
    and clenched it tightly under his desk. Shuya felt a wave of relief.
    They weren't all consumed by this insanity yet. The bonds of love had
    yet to be severed.&nbsp;</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But...what
    was her message?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Shuya wondered as she left the classroom.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe—he
    glanced at the map Sakamochi had scrawled on the blackboard—she'd
    designated one of the areas for a meeting? But that map on the
    blackboard was too crude, and there was no guarantee at all it'd
    correspond to the maps they were given. Maybe she indicated a general
    direction or distance. Besides, the fact that they wanted to secretly
    meet only meant they didn't trust anyone else and they were certain
    others would try to kill them. Which in the end meant they were
    falling into Sakamochi's trap.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    have no idea what lies beyond this room but I should at the very
    least be able to wait&nbsp;outside and talk to the students after me.
    None of Sakamochi's rules prohibit me from doing this. Everyone might
    be panicking from suspicion, but if we can just get together and
    discuss the situation then I'm sure we can come up with a plan.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Plus, Noriko was the one who came immediately after him (could she
    walk though?). Shinji Mimura also came after him. Hiroki Sugimura
    would leave before him though....</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    considered passing a note to Hiroki but his seat was too far.
    Besides, if he tried anything he could end up like Fumiyo Fujiyoshi.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    Sugimura was up next. His eyes met Shuya's briefly right before he
    exited the room's sliding door...but that was all. In his mind, Shuya
    sighed deeply. He could only hope Hiroki had the same idea and would
    be waiting outside. If he could talk the others into waiting too...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    front and behind him, the quiet ones, Shogo Kawada, Kazuo Kiriyama,
    and Mitsuko Souma, left one by one.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Chewing
    his gum, Shogo exited with an indifferent look on his face,
    completely ignoring Sakamochi and the camouflaged trio. Kiriyama and
    Souma left the same way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course. When Sakamochi said, &quot;There are others willing to do
    it,&quot; the rest of the class must have immediately suspected these
    three students. Because they were &quot;delinquents.&quot; They might

    Shuya doubted Kazuo Kiriyama would. Kazuo had his own gang. On top of
    that, his gang was a lot tighter than your typical group of buddies.
    Hiroshi Kuronaga, Ryuhei Sasagawa, Sho Tsukioka, and Mitsuru Numai.
    The rules of this game turned everyone else into your enemy, but the
    five of them killing each other was unimaginable. Besides— Shuya
    made a careful note of this—when he left, his boys looked
    disturbingly calm. Kazuo probably passed around a note to the others.
    He's probably planning an escape for the five of them. Kazuo was more
    than capable of out-maneuvering the government. Of course, this also
    meant that Kazuo wouldn't trust anyone besides his gang.</font></font></p>

    Souma had a similar kind of group. Her seat was too far from the

    Kawada was the only one who troubled Shuya. Shogo Kawada had no
    group. In fact he didn't even have a single friend. Ever since he
    transferred to their school, he hardly spoke to anyone in the class.
    On top of that, there was something elusive about Shogo. Even if he
    ignored the rumors, there were those wounds covering his entire
    body...</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    it felt incredibly short, an hour must have passed according to his
    calculations (of course with Yoshitoki Kuninobu the elapsed time was
    reduced by two minutes). Female Student No. 14 Mayumi Tendo vanished
    into the hall, and Sakamochi called out, &quot;Male Student No. 15,
    Shuya Nanahara.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Instead

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    raised his voice, &quot;Shuya,&quot; and his knife. &quot;Wrong
    direction.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stopped. The three soldiers had their rifles cocked. His throat
    stiffened. Then he said nervously, &quot;Yoshitoki Kuninobu was my
    friend. The least I could do is close his eyes. According to the
    Great Dictator's education policy, we're supposed to respect the
    dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    hesitated for a moment, but then he grinned and put his knife down.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You're
    so caring, Shuya. All right then.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a small breath, then stepped forward. He stopped in front of
    Noriko's desk, where Yoshitoki's corpse was lying.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    he'd demanded the right to close his friend's eyes, he couldn't help
    but freeze up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    that he was up close he saw, courtesy of the frivolous one, thin, red
    flesh and something white in Yoshitoki's blood-stained short hair. He
    realized it was bone. Thanks to the bullets wedged inside his head,
    Yoshitoki's big eyes bulged out even further. He looked stupefied
    with the upturned eyes of a starving refugee waiting to be fed. Pink,
    slimy liquid consisting of blood and saliva dripped out of his mouth,
    which opened slightly. Dark blood poured out of his nostrils. It
    flowed down his chin and into the pool of blood pouring out of his
    chest. It was horrible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    placed his bag near him and leaned over. He lifted Yoshitoki's body,
    which was lying down face first. As Shuya lifted him, blood came
    pouring out of the chest of his blackened school uniform, which was
    torn in three places, and splashed onto the floor. His lanky body
    felt incredibly light. Was it because all that blood had been drained
    out of him?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding
    Yoshitoki's light body, Shuya's head cooled down. More than sadness
    or fear, it was anger that overwhelmed him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Yoshitoki...I'm
    going to avenge your death. I swear to you that I will.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    wasn't much time. He wiped the blood off Yoshitoki's face with the
    palm of his hand, then gently closed his eyes. He laid his body down
    and clasped his hands on his chest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    as he pretended to fumble over picking up his bag, he leaned over to
    Noriko as close as he could and quickly whispered, &quot;Can you
    walk?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was enough to provoke the camouflaged trio to reach for their rifles,
    but Shuya managed to get a nod from Noriko. Shuya turned to Sakamochi
    and the trio, clenched his fist for Noriko to see, and pointed his
    thumb to the exit to indicate: I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting
    outside.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    didn't look back at Noriko, but out of the corner of his eye he
    looked beyond Yoshitoki's desk, where Shinji Mimura stared ahead,
    faintly smiling with his arms folded. He might have seen Shuya's
    signal. Shuya felt all the more relieved. It was Shinji. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>If
    Shinji's on our side, we can escape, no prob.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shinji Mimura may have been more aware of their situation than Shuya
    was. He might have been saying with that grin, &quot;</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Well,
    this may be adios amigos, Shuya</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.&quot;
    The thought didn't occur to Shuya at the time though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    continued to walk. He took a moment to think before he received his
    black day pack, and he did the same as he approached Fumiyo
    Fujiyoshi's corpse, shutting his eyes. He wanted to remove the knife
    from her forehead, but decided against it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    he stepped out of the classroom, he felt a pang of regret, wishing he

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    hall was unlit. Only the light from the classroom shone on the floor
    planks. The windows on the side of the hall were also sealed with
    sheets of black steel. They provided protection against attacks from
    rebellious students like Shuya who might decide to escape the game.
    Of course, as soon as they were off, this area would already be
    forbidden.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked to his right. There was another room, then another, both
    identical to the room he'd just exited. And then at the end of the
    dark hall there was what looked like a double-door exit. At the end
    of the hall there was another room on the left.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Was
    it the school's faculty room? The door was open and the lights were
    on. Shuya looked beyond the door, where a legion of Special Defense
    Forces soldiers were sitting on steel folding chairs behind a wide
    desk. Twenty or thirty? No, there were as many soldiers as there were
    students.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    fact, Shuya was hoping that if his day pack came equipped with a gun
    (it was possible—along with &quot;knife wound&quot; and &quot;choking,&quot;
    &quot;gunshot wound&quot; was listed as a cause of death in the
    Program reports), or if some of the others waiting for him were
    equipped with guns, then they could use them against Sakamochi and
    his men before everyone departed, in other words, before the school
    became a forbidden zone. But this hope was immediately extinguished.
    The three men with Sakamochi weren't the only soldiers accompanying
    him. Of course, that wasn't at all surprising.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One
    of the soldiers tilted his head and glanced up from the mug in his
    hand at Shuya. Like the faces of the trio in the classroom, his also
    lacked any expression.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took to his heels and hurried to the exit. He rushed impatiently. So
    now...now the only thing they could do was unite. But...maybe there
    were soldiers stationed outside to prevent them from waiting for each
    other? Still...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    quickly ran through the dark corridor and went through the double
    doors. He descended several porch stairs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Under
    the moon, an empty athletic field the size of three tennis courts
    spread out beyond the building. There were woods beyond the field. To
    his left was a small mountain. His field of vision expanded on the
    right. A pitch-black darkness spread out—the sea. Small points of
    light twinkled beyond the ocean. It must be </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>the
    mainland</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    The Program officially took place within the prefecture of the
    selected junior high school. Sometimes the location was a mountain
    surrounded by high-voltage fences, or abandoned prison houses that
    hadn't yet been demolished, but for Kagawa Prefecture the Program was
    usually held on an island. According to the local news reports he'd
    seen (of course, in each case the location would only be announced
    after the game was over), every game in Kagawa took place on an
    island. This time was no exception. Sakamochi didn't mention the name
    of the island, but once Shuya checked its shape on the map he might
    be able to tell. Or maybe a building would reveal the name of the
    island.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    soft breeze blew in. He could smell the sea. It was cold for a May
    evening but it wasn't unbearable.&nbsp;He'd have to be careful when
    he slept not to tire himself from exposure.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was no one. There weren't any soldiers, but Shuya was disappointed to
    find none of his classmates there. As Sakamochi had anticipated,
    everyone was hiding out. Even Hiroki Sugimura wasn't there. Only the
    soft breeze mixed in with the smell of the sea came drifting through
    the athletic field.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    glanced back at the dark interior of the school building. They were
    told anyone loitering in the hall would be immediately shot, but the
    soldiers in the room at the end of the corridor didn't pay any
    particular attention to Shuya. They weren't exactly chatting up a
    storm. They just sat around, unarmed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    licked his lips and decided it was best for him to move away from the
    door. He looked outside again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That's

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    didn't see it last time because he was too preoccupied with the
    overall view, but this time he saw something that looked like a
    garbage bag lying at his feet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wondered whether it was someone's day pack, dropped by accident, but
    then his eyes widened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    wasn't a garbage bag, nor was it someone's day pack. There was hair
    growing out of one end. Human hair.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a human being. Wearing a sailor suit school uniform. The body was
    in a V-shape, lying on its side, face down. The single pony tail tied
    with a wide ribbon looked familiar. No wonder. He'd just seen her off
    only three minutes ago. The stiff body belonged to Female Student No.
    14, Mayumi Tendo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    beside her lobster-shaped braided hair, a dull, silver,
    twenty-centimeter stick poked out of the back of her uniform,
    diagonally, like a transistor radio antenna. There were four tiny
    flaps resembling a fighter plane's tail at the end of the stick.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    recalled Sakamochi's reply to Kiriyama, who asked when the game

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stopped speculating and cautiously crouched down and checked the
    premises.&nbsp;For some reason...there was no sign of the attacker.
    No arrows had flown at him when he'd been standing in a daze. Why?
    Satisfied with killing only Mayumi Tendo, did the assailant leave the
    premises?&nbsp;Or...was this some engineered &quot;provocation&quot;?
    Did the soldiers at the end of the hall kill her to convince everyone
    that some of their classmates were already willing to play the game?

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    silver object whizzed right by Shuya's eyes. Yes—it came directly
    down, from above. Another antenna was planted in the ground.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shuddered. If he hadn't been standing at the exit, waiting for

    on top of the building.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    clenched his teeth, snatched up the arrow, and ran to his left. He
    moved impulsively but in an erratic way that eluded the assailant. He
    turned around and looked up. Under the dim moonlit sky, a large, dark
    shadow loomed above the gabled roof of the single-story school
    building.</font></font></p>

    to surprise him Shuya threw the arrow at the shadow. But thanks to
    Shuya's gifts as a star shortstop, the arrow flew at incredible speed
    and traced a fine arc right at the shadow. The shadow groaned, held
    its face, hunched over, and then began to sway. Then it fell.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stepped back and watched the shadow fall from a height of at least
    three meters and land with a thud on the ground. The object in the
    assailant's hand fell with a metallic crash.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Light
    leaked through the building exit. The large shadow was lying face
    down, wearing a school uniform. It was Yoshio Akamatsu. He was
    motionless now, perhaps because he was unconscious. A hybrid between
    a bow and rifle—were they called bow guns?—was lying by his hand.
    The day pack that had fallen by Yoshio's feet was half open. Shuya
    saw a stack of silver arrows inside.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt a sudden chill. It was true. He was participating! Yoshio

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned around. It was Noriko, who'd taken the situation in as she
    held her breath in surprise. Shuya's eyes went from Noriko's face to
    Mayumi Tendo—he ran over to Mayumi and touched her neck to check
    her pulse. She was dead. There was no doubt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    brain felt like a fuse fizzling out. Others might be in the same
    state of mind as Yoshio. And one of them might just suddenly return
    this time, perhaps with a gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had no choice but to change his attitude toward the game now. So this
    was it. When Sakamochi said, &quot;As soon as you leave here,&quot;
    this was what he'd meant.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stood up and ran to Noriko. He took her by the hand.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We're
    running! Do your best, you have to run!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    began running, half-dragging Noriko, whose leg was injured. Which way
    though?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    couldn't afford to deliberate over his decisions. He headed towards
    the grove. First they'd hide in the grove, then they could, no—he
    dismissed the thought. Given Noriko's condition, they were
    defenseless against any attack. Staying near the area was too
    dangerous.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Waiting
    in front of the building for the others was completely out of the
    question. He rushed Noriko, and they entered the grove. Tall trees
    mixed in with short trees, and the ground was covered with fern.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned to yell some warning to the remaining eleven students coming
    out (in their class of twenty-one pairs of boys and girls, there
    should have been twelve students following Shuya's and Noriko's seat
    numbers, but Fumiyo Fujiyoshi had to be counted out), but he gave up
    on the idea. Shuya reached the somewhat forced conclusion that they
    probably weren't as foolish as he was, so they'd flee the moment they
    emerged from the building anyway, especially once they saw Mayumi
    Tendo's corpse. For a moment he thought of Shinji Mimura—but he
    gave up on this idea too. Once again he forced himself into believing
    that there had to be some other strategy, another way for them to
    meet up. In any case, they had to leave.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding
    Noriko Nakagawa tightly, he haphazardly led their way into the grove.
    A bird cried out, &quot;kaw kaw,&quot; and ruffled its wings as it
    flew away. He couldn't see it, but it didn't matter. He had no time
    to observe it anyway.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he sat up, the sky and earth rotating ninety degrees, an empty field
    unexpectedly spread out in front of him. There was a mountain beyond
    the field, shaped like a bow, darker than the night sky.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    of a sudden, everything came back. Sakamochi, Mr. Hayashida's corpse,
    Yoshio's departure, discovering the bow gun in his day pack once he
    found some shelter in a small shack, his returning here, observing
    Takako Chigusa (Female Student No. 13) whose face was a little severe
    but beautiful, looking tense now as the track team's best runner
    dashed away at full speed, him struggling up the thin steel ladder by
    the side of the building in order to reach the roof. Then how, due to
    the trouble he had loading his bow gun with an arrow, Sho Tsukioka
    (Male No. 14) also managed to escape his reach. And then...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshio
    turned around and saw the girl in the sailor suit uniform lying
    there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    didn't exactly come as a surprise to Yoshio. What he felt now in
    conjunction with his memory wasn't guilt over killing one of his
    classmates so much as it was fear. It might have resembled a gigantic
    billboard sign standing in the middle of a wasteland inside his mind.
    On the sign were letters in blood that read, &quot;I'm going to kill
    you!&quot; In the background all his classmates held weapons like
    axes and pistols, attacking Yoshio, who stood in front of the sign as
    if it were a 3D movie.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course killing your classmates was wrong. And besides once the game
    time had expired they were all going to die anyway so it might have
    been absurd to fight at all. But that was just too rational. The
    fact&nbsp;was that Yoshio simply did not want to die. He was
    petrified by any of his classmates who'd bare their teeth at him.
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Just
    think about it, you're surrounded by a swarm of assassins.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    so his choice to reduce &quot;the enemy&quot; as efficiently as
    possible wasn't motivated by rational thoughts but instead from a
    deeper, primal fear of death. There was no need to discern your
    allies from your enemies. Everyone had to be an enemy. After all when
    Ryuhei Sasagawa used to pick on him, everyone looked the other way.</font></font></p>

    Niida (Male Student No. 16) emerged from the building two minutes
    after Noriko Nakagawa. He stood at the exit for a while, shaking. The
    bow gun lying next to Yoshio Akamatsu's body was still loaded with an
    arrow. Although Kazushi had picked it up, he had no intention of
    shooting Yoshio. But the moment Yoshio stood up, he reflexively
    pulled the trigger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    did his best to overcome his panic. The first thing was to get out of
    here. That was the priority. What he should have done in the first
    place was ignore Yoshio Akamatsu and Mayumi Tendo completely and run
    away. Given the circumstances, he had no other choice but to kill
    Yoshio. Yoshio Akamatsu had obviously killed Mayumi Tendo. So Kazushi
    hadn't done anything wrong.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Had
    they been running for ten minutes now? With his arm still wrapped
    around Noriko, he signaled they should be still, and they both
    stopped. Under the hazy moonlight shining through the branches
    overhead, Noriko looked up at him. Their heavy breathing echoed like
    a giant wall of sound, but Shuya tried his best to listen beyond the
    wall for other sounds in the area enveloped in darkness.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No
    one seemed to be chasing them. They were too short of breath to sigh,
    but they could relax a little now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he dropped his bags, a sharp pain ran through his right shoulder. He
    was in poor shape. An electric guitar was heavier than a bat, but it
    wasn't something you swung around. After putting the bags down, he
    placed his hands on his thighs and tried to rest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    urged Noriko to sit in the dark grove. After he checked again for any
    other suspicious sounds, he sat down next to her. The thick grass
    underneath them made a crunching sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt as if they'd covered a good distance, but given how they'd been
    zigzagging, and how they'd lost all sense of direction climbing the
    mountain, they might have only been a few hundred meters away from
    the school. At least the light leaking out of the building was no
    longer visible. This might have just been due to the thickness of the
    grove or the gentle slopes, though. Anyway it felt safer deep inside
    the dark grove. His decision was impulsive, but he was certain it was
    safer than the wide open seaside.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked over at Noriko and whispered, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    murmured, &quot;Yes.&quot; She nodded slightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt the urge to stay here for a while, but that wasn't an option.
    First he opened up the day pack. He dug into it, groping around, and
    found an object that felt like a bottle of water.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pulled it out. The sheath felt like leather and a leather grip poked
    out of it. It was an army knife. Sakamochi said that the day pack was
    equipped with a weapon. Was this it? He searched the bag a little
    more, but nothing else inside resembled a weapon. Only a bag that
    seemed to contain bread and a flashlight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    unfastened the sheath and removed the knife. The blade was
    approximately fifteen centimeters long, and after checking it he
    returned it to the sheath and tucked it under his school uniform
    belt. He unfastened the lowest button on his uniform to make the grip
    immediately accessible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    grabbed Noriko's day pack and opened the zipper. He knew he wasn't
    supposed to go through a girl's things, but Noriko didn't pack this
    bag.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    found something strange. It was a curved stick approximately forty
    centimeters long. It had the texture of smooth, hard wood. Was this
    what they called a boomerang? A weapon used for fighting and hunting
    in primitive tribes. An aboriginal village hunting hero might be able
    to knock down an ailing, sluggish kangaroo with this thing, but what
    use could it possibly have for them? Shuya sighed and returned it to
    Noriko's day pack.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    finally stopped heaving like drown victims gasping for air.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    want some water?&quot; Shuya asked.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded and said, &quot;Just a little.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took out the plastic bottle from his day pack, broke the seal of the
    twist-off top, and sniffed the contents. He spilled some on his hand
    and licked it cautiously. Then after taking a sip, making sure he had
    no abnormal reaction, he handed it over to Noriko. Noriko took the
    bottle and only swallowed a small mouthful. She probably knew that
    water was precious. Each bottle only contained approximately one
    liter, and they'd only have two. Sakamochi said they had no access to
    telephones, but what about the water system?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Let
    me take a look at your leg.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded to Shuya's request and stretched out her right leg, which had
    been tucked in under her&nbsp;skirt. Shuya took out the flashlight
    from his day pack. He cupped it carefully with the palm of his hand
    to prevent its light from leaking out and pointed it at her leg
    wound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    wound was on the outer calf. A section of flesh approximately four
    centimeters long and one centimeter deep had been scraped off. A thin
    stream of blood still flowed out of the ends of the pinkish flesh
    wound. It looked like she needed stitches.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    quickly turned off his flashlight and grabbed his sports bag instead
    of his day pack. He grabbed the bourbon flask and two clean bandannas
    he'd packed for the trip. He uncapped the flask.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    is going to hurt.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    be okay,&quot; Noriko said, but once Shuya tilted the flask and
    poured the bourbon to disinfect her wound, she let out a small hiss.
    Shuya pressed one folded bandanna onto her wound. He opened up the
    other one, folded it, then began wrapping it around her leg tightly
    like a bandage. This would stop the bleeding for now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    wrapping her leg, he pulled at both ends of the bandage tightly, tied
    them together, and mumbled, &quot;Damn...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    whispered, &quot;You mean Nobu?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yoshitoki,
    Yoshio. Everyone and everything. I'm not into this. I am so not into
    this.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he moved his hands Shuya glanced at Noriko. Then he looked down and
    finished tying his knot. Noriko thanked him and tucked her leg in.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    Yoshio was the one who killed...&quot; her voice was trembling,
    &quot;...Mayumi?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes.
    He was above the exit door. I threw the arrow at him and he fell.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    that he thought about it, Shuya suddenly realized he hadn't taken
    care of Yoshio. He'd instinctively assumed Yoshio would remain
    unconscious for a while, but for all he knew Yoshio might have woken
    up immediately afterwards.&nbsp;Which meant he might have taken his
    bow gun, climbed up on the roof, and continued his slaughter.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Was
    I being too naïve again? Should I have just killed him over there?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    this thought Shuya checked his watch under the moonlight. The old,
    domestically manufactured Hattori Hanzo limited-edition diver's watch
    (along with most of his belongings, it had been donated to Shuya
    through the orphanage) read 2:40. Everyone might have left by now. At
    most there were only two or three students left, regardless of Yoshio
    Akamatsu's state. Shinji Mimura had already...Shuya was nearly
    certain Shinji could easily escape Yoshio...By now he'd already left
    too.</font></font></p>

    shook his head. Now he felt foolish believing they could unite
    against their situation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    never thought someone like him would actually try to kill everyone
    else to survive. I understand the rules, but I didn't think anyone
    would actually participate.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    might be wrong about that though,&quot; Noriko said.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh?&quot;
    Shuya looked into Noriko's face, too dark to discern under the
    moonlight. Noriko continued,&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    know how Yoshio was always timid. I think he was scared. That must've
    been&nbsp;it. I mean you have no idea who might turn against you. He
    might have been convinced everyone was coming after him. I think he
    was really scared. And that if he didn't do anything he would end up
    being...killed...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    sat down against the nearest tree trunk and stretched his legs out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    ones who were terrified might try to kill each other...The same idea
    had occurred to Shuya, but he had also thought the ones who were
    scared would basically hide out. But if they were terrified out of
    their wits, they might actually take their own initiative.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    get it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,&quot;
    Noriko nodded. &quot;It's still horrible that he started killing
    indiscriminately.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    remained silent for a while. Then Shuya came up with an idea. &quot;Hey,
    you think if he'd seen the two of us together he wouldn't have
    attacked us? Wouldn't it prove we're not playing the game?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well
    yes, maybe.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    started thinking. If as Noriko said Yoshio had just been overwhelmed
    by paranoia...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    moment back there was when he first realized someone was willing to
    play. That was why he fled. But maybe that was wrong. How could they
    possibly kill each other? It was outrageous. Then should he have
    waited for the others, leaving aside what he should have done with
    Yoshio?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Either
    way, it was too late now. Everyone would be gone by now even if they
    went back. Besides, did Yoshio do that simply out of fear?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was getting confused.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    Noriko.&quot; Noriko lifted her face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    do you think? I fled from the school grounds the moment I realized
    there might be others like Yoshio. But...if he really did it out
    fear...in other words, do you really think any of us would actually
    participate? What I mean is that... I'm thinking of gathering
    everyone together to escape from this game. What do you think?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Everyone?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    fell silent and tucked her knees under her skirt. Then she said,
    &quot;Maybe I'm not as generous.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    couldn't handle some of them. I could trust my friends....&quot;
    Noriko mentioned the name of their class representative, Yukie
    Utsumi. Shuya knew Yukie since elementary school.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Like
    Yukie. But I don't think I could trust the other girls. There's no
    way I could be with them. Don't you think? I have no idea what was
    going through Yoshio's mind, but I'm afraid of everyone else too. I
    mean...I just realized I don't know a thing about everyone else. I
    don't know what they're really like. I mean...you can't see into
    someone's mind.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    don't know a thing about everyone else.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was right, Shuya thought. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What
    do I know about this group that I spend the day with at school? He
    suddenly felt like there was an enemy out there.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    continued, &quot;So I-I'd be suspicious. Unless it was someone I
    really trusted, I'd be suspicious of them. I'd be afraid they might
    want to kill me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    sighed. The game was horrible. But it also seemed flawless. In the
    end, it was a bad idea to invite everyone indiscriminately to form a
    group unless you were certain about them. What if—let's just say
    what if—they betrayed you? It wasn't just his life but Noriko's too
    he'd be endangering. Yes—it was only natural the others before him
    had immediately fled the premises. That was more realistic.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on a sec,&quot; Shuya said. Noriko glanced up at Shuya. &quot;Then
    that means us being together won't necessarily prove we're harmless.
    The others might suspect that I plan on killing you eventually.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded. &quot;Yes, I'll be suspected too, just like you. A classmate
    might avoid us once they see us together, but I also think anyone we
    invite will turn away. I mean it would depend on each person.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    held his breath. &quot;It would be scary.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,
    it's really scary.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    the ones who fled from the school premises might have been right. But
    what mattered to him was protecting Noriko Nakagawa, the girl
    Yoshitoki adored. Maybe he should have been content with the fact
    that at the very least Noriko Nakagawa was safe by his side now. He
    had done the safest thing. But...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But,&quot;
    he said, &quot;at the very least I wanted Shinji to join us. I think
    he'd come up with a really good plan. You'd be okay with Shinji,
    right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded and said, &quot;Of course.&quot; Given the amount of time she
    spoke with Shuya at school, she had many occasions to talk to Shinji
    Mimura. Beside,&nbsp;Shuya recalled how Shinji had helped her up and
    how he'd signaled him to calm down. He realized now that if Shinji
    hadn't done those things, he and Noriko would have remained dazed and
    been shot down like Yoshitoki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if she were thinking along the same lines that led to the inevitable,
    she looked down and quietly said, &quot;So Nobu's gone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    Shuya answered quietly, as if it were a bizarre fact, &quot;I guess
    so.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    they fell silent again. They could reminisce but now was not the
    time. Besides, Shuya couldn't bring himself to take a stroll down
    memory lane over Yoshitoki. It was too heavy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    wonder what we should do.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    stiffened her mouth and nodded without a word.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    wonder if there might be a way to gather the ones we trust together.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's...&quot;
    Noriko considered it, then became silent once again. It was
    true—there was no way. At least for now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    sighed deeply once again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked up and saw through the twigs the gray night sky dimly glowing
    under the moonlight. So this was what it meant to be in a &quot;no-win
    situation.&quot; If they simply wanted everyone to join, all they had
    to do was walk around and shout. But that would be an open invitation
    to get themselves killed by any of their opponents. Of course he
    hoped there weren't any opponents but...in the end, he had to admit
    he was scared too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    thought led to an idea, though. Shuya turned to her and asked, &quot;But
    you're not afraid of me?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Didn't
    you wonder whether I'd try to kill you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Under
    the moonlight, he couldn't see well, but Noriko's eyes seemed to
    widen a little. &quot;You would never do something so horrible.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought a little more. Then he said, &quot;But you can't know what
    someone's thinking. You said yourself.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,&quot;
    Noriko shook her head. &quot;I just know that you would never do
    that.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at her face directly. He probably looked dazed. &quot;You
    can...tell?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes...I
    can. I...&quot; She hesitated, but then continued, &quot;I've been
    watching you for so long now.&quot; She might have delivered these
    words more stiffly in a normal situation, or at least one that was a
    little more romantic.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was how Shuya recalled the anonymous love letter he'd received
    written on light blue stationary. Someone had put it inside his desk
    one day in April. This wasn't the first love letter the former star
    shortstop and current self-proclaimed (sometimes by others as well)
    rock and roll star of Shiroiwa Junior High had received, but it made
    enough of an impression on Shuya for him to hold onto it. There was a
    poetic quality to the letter that touched him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    read, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>&quot;Even
    if it's a lie, even if it's a dream, please turn to me. Your smile on
    a certain day isn't a lie, it's not a dream. But having it turn to me
    might be my lie, my dream. But the day you call my name, it won't be
    a lie, it won't be a dream.&quot;</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    And then, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>&quot;It's
    never been a lie, it's never been a dream that I love you.&quot;</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Was
    Noriko the one who sent that letter? He remembered observing how the
    writing resembled hers, and how the poetic style seemed similar too.
    So then...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought of asking her about the letter, but decided not to. This
    wasn't the right time. Besides, he had no right to bring it up. After
    all he was so hung up over another girl, Kazumi Shintani, who would
    never, to take the phrase from that love letter, &quot;turn to him,&quot;
    other girls and that love letter were of little concern to him in
    comparison. The most important thing now for him was to protect &quot;the
    girl Yoshitoki Kuninobu adored,&quot; not to find out &quot;who had a
    crush on him.&quot;&nbsp;Then he recalled the bashful look Yoshitoki
    gave him when they had that talk. &quot;Hey Shuya, I got a crush on
    someone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    asked him, &quot;What about you, Shuya? Aren't you afraid of me? No,
    wait, why then did you help me?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well...&quot;
    Shuya thought of telling her about Yoshitoki. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Come
    on, my best friend had a crush on you. So if&nbsp;I'm going to help
    anyone, it's got to be you, no matter what. I mean, really, come on.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    decided against this too. They were better off discussing this later,
    hopefully when they could take the time to, assuming that is, there
    would be any time later.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    were injured. I couldn't just leave you alone. And besides, I trust
    you. I'll be damned if I didn't trust someone cute as you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    broke into a slight grin. Shuya did his best to return the smile.
    They were in a horrible situation, but he felt slight relief in
    forming a smile.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    said, &quot;In any case, we're lucky. At least we're together.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    what were they supposed to do now?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    began packing his bag. If they were going to rest in order to come up
    with a strategy, they needed to find a place that offered visibility.
    Again, they had no idea what the others were up to. At the very least
    they had to be extremely cautious. That was what it meant to be
    realistic in the face of horrific circumstances.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    kept the map, compass, and flashlight by his side. This was the

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    Numai (Male Student No. 17) proceeded cautiously between the grove
    and the narrow moonlit beach that was approximately ten meters wide.
    He was carrying his issued day pack and his own bag on his shoulder.
    He held a small automatic pistol in his right hand. (It was a Walther
    PPK 9mm. Compared to the other weapons that had been issued in this
    game, this one ranked high. Along with most of the guns used in this
    program, this mass-produced model was imported cheaply from Third
    World countries that had remained neutral towards both the nations of
    the Republic of Greater East Asia and the American Empire and its
    allies.) Mitsuru was familiar with a model-gun version of the pistol,
    so he didn't need the accompanying manual. He even knew there was no
    need to cock the pistol before pulling the trigger. It came with a
    cartridge of ammunition which he'd since loaded into the gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    gun in his hand made him feel somewhat secure, but he held something
    even more important in his left hand, the supplied compass. It was
    the same cheap tin model Shuya had, but it did the job. Forty minutes
    prior to his departure from the classroom, his great leader, Kazuo
    Kiriyama (Male Student No. 6) had passed him this note: &quot;If
    we're really on an island, then I'll be waiting at the southern tip.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course everyone was an enemy in this game. That was the fundamental
    rule. But the bond in the &quot;Kiriyama Family&quot; was absolute.
    It didn't matter that they were labeled thugs. They were thick as
    thieves.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore,
    the bond between Mitsuru Numai and Kazuo Kiriyama was special.
    Because...in a way it was Mitsuru who made Kazuo Kiriyama into what
    he was now. If there was one thing he knew, that the&nbsp;other more
    square students like Shuya Nanahara didn't, it was the fact that as
    far as Mitsuru knew, Kazuo Kiriyama, at least until junior high, was
    no &quot;delinquent.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru's
    memory of his first encounter with Kazuo Kiriyama was so vivid it
    remained unforgettable.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    had been a bully ever since elementary school. But he was never
    needlessly cruel. Brought up in a generic family, he wasn't
    particularly bright, nor did he display any other gifts. Fighting was
    the best way he could prove himself. &quot;Strength&quot; was the
    only standard he had, and he never fell short of it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    it was only inevitable, on his first day in junior high, he'd do his
    best to discourage any competitors coming from other elementary
    schools in his district. Of course, judging from the strength of kids
    he'd encountered in the local hang-outs, he knew the kids from the
    other elementary schools hardly presented a threat. Not everyone
    might have heard of him, though. There should be only one king—
    that was the best way to maintain order. Of course he wouldn't have
    thought to put it this way, but he knew this was what was going on.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    expected, there were two or three competitors. It all happened after
    the entrance ceremony and class introduction, after school, when he
    was in the process of taking care of the last one.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the deserted hall by the art classroom, Mitsuru grabbed the kid by
    the lapels and shoved him against the wall. The kid was already
    bruised above the eye. His eyes were brimming with tears. It was a
    cinch. It'd only taken two punches.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Got
    it? So you don't mess around with me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    kid nodded his head frantically. He was probably just begging to be
    released, but Mitsuru wanted verbal confirmation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    asking you! Did you get that!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    thrust the kid's body up with his left arm. &quot;Answer me. Am I the
    baddest guy in his school? Am I?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    became irritated because his opponent wasn't responding. He lifted
    him up higher, when he suddenly felt those eyes on him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    let go of the kid and turned around. The kid fell to the floor and
    scrambled away, but there was no way Mitsuru could go after him now
    anyway.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was surrounded by four guys much taller than him. The badges on their
    worn out collars indicated they were third-year students. You could
    immediately tell what they were. They were just like him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    kid,&quot; the pimply faced one who had a creepy grin said. &quot;You
    shouldn't pick on the weak.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another
    one with orange-tinted hair down to his shoulders pursed his
    abnormally thick lips and continued, &quot;You've been naughty.&quot;
    His &quot;faggoty&quot; voice made the four of them crack up,
    laughing, &quot;HEEEE,&quot; as if they were all insane.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We'll
    have to teach you a lesson.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,
    we must.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    they screeched again, &quot;Hee hee!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    tried a surprise kick at the pimply faced one in front of him, but he
    was immediately tripped by the one on his left.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    soon as he fell back, the pimply one kicked him in the face, knocking
    out his front teeth. The back of&nbsp;his head pounded against the
    wall that he'd been busy using on his classmate. He felt dizzy.
    Something hot oozed down the back of his head. Mitsuru tried to get
    up on all fours, but then the one on his right kicked him in the
    stomach. Mitsuru groaned and puked. One of them said, &quot;What a
    fucking mess.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Damn</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    he thought. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Bastards...fucking
    cowards...I could take on any of them if it was just one on one....</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    there was nothing he could do now. After all, he'd been the one who
    deliberately chose a deserted place to intimidate his classmate.
    There wasn't a chance a teacher would appear.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    pressed his right wrist against the floor. One of them carefully
    pried Mitsuru's index finger back and tucked it under his leather
    shoe. For the first time in his life Mitsuru experienced real fear.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>No...this
    can't be</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was. The sole of the shoe came down as Mitsuru's finger made a
    horrible cracking sound. Mitsuru shrieked. He'd never been in such
    pain. They kept laughing, &quot;Hee hee hee!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    thought. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>These
    bastards...they're insane...they're not at all like me...they're
    crazy...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were preparing his middle finger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;S-stop...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    an ounce of pride left, Mitsuru begged for mercy, but they ignored
    his pleas. The same cracking noise came. Mitsuru's middle finger was
    ruined now. Mitsuru screamed again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Let's
    have one more then.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That's
    when it happened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    door to the art classroom suddenly slid open.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Can
    you guys keep it down?&quot; The voice was quiet, though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    a moment Mitsuru wondered if it was a teacher. But a teacher would
    have intervened a lot sooner, and besides, a request to keep it down
    would have been strange.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    his back still pressed to the floor Mitsuru glanced over at the door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    wasn't too big, but he was incredibly good looking. He was holding a
    paint brush.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    seen him at the class introduction. He was one of Mitsuru's
    classmates. His family seemed to have recently moved here. No one
    knew who he was, but since he was quiet and appeared obedient Mitsuru
    didn't pay much attention to him. Given how his looks were so
    refined, he probably came from a nice family. Someone like him would
    do his best to avoid fights, so he was nothing to worry about.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    what was he doing in the art classroom? Probably painting, but wasn't
    that a little strange on the first day of school?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    pimply guy went up to the boy. &quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot; He
    stood in front of the boy. &quot;Who the fuck are you? First year?
    What the fuck are you doing here? Huh? What was that you said?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    knocked the paint brush out of the boy's hand, and the dark blue
    paint from the brush splattered against the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    boy slowly looked up at the pimply guy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rest needed little explanation. The small boy beat up the four
    third-year students. (They were all lying on the floor, completely
    paralyzed.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    boy approached Mitsuru. After looking him over he only said, &quot;You
    should have your hand examined at a hospital.&quot; Then he went back
    inside the classroom.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    gazed at the four bodies lying on the floor. He was completely
    stunned by something so completely unprecedented. He felt in awe of
    the boy, like a rookie boxer doomed to mediocrity upon suddenly
    encountering a world champion. Mitsuru saw genius.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From
    that point on Mitsuru served that boy—Kazuo Kiriyama. He had no
    need to acknowledge it. Kazuo Kiriyama had beaten up four guys at
    once when Mitsuru could have only taken them on one on one. There
    should only be one king, and those who weren't should serve under
    him. He reached this conclusion a long time ago. The idea probably
    came from his favorite boys' manga magazine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    Kiriyama was a mystery.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    Mitsuru asked how he managed to learn how to fight so viciously, he'd
    only respond, &quot;I just learned.&quot; Kazuo would only ignore any
    further attempts to find out more. Mitsuru would then try to coax
    more out of him by suggesting he must have had a reputation in
    elementary school, but Kazuo only denied it. Then maybe he'd been a
    champion in karate or something? Kazuo denied this too. Another odd
    point, Mitsuru learned later, was the fact that Kazuo had broken into
    the art classroom to paint the day they met. When Mitsuru asked why
    he did that, Kazuo only replied, &quot;I just felt like it.&quot;
    This was how Kazuo's strange persona contributed to Mitsuru's
    attraction to him. (Furthermore, the quality of the painting
    depicting a view from the classroom of the empty courtyard far
    exceeded the first-year junior high level, but Mitsuru never got to
    see this painting, because Kazuo had tossed it into the trash after
    completing it.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    showed Kazuo around. The small town, including the cafe where his
    friends hung out, the place he stashed stolen goods, the shady dealer
    who provided illegal goods. Mitsuru's talents were in fighting, but
    he did his best to show him every place. he knew. Kazuo always
    appeared calm. He came along maybe out of curiosity. Eventually he
    took on upper class students besides the ones he'd beaten up, bullies
    from other schools, or sometimes high school students.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    exception Kazuo had them instantly writhing on the ground. Mitsuru
    was crazy about Kazuo. It was perhaps no different from the joy a
    trainer feels in training a champion boxer.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    wasn't only strong, though. He was extremely smart. Quite simply, he
    excelled at everything. When they broke into the liquor store's
    warehouse, it was Kazuo who came up with the brilliant plan. Kazuo
    saved Mitsuru from numerous jams he got himself into. (Since he got
    involved with Kazuo, he never got arrested by the police.)
    Furthermore, his father was supposedly the president of a leading
    corporation in the prefecture—no, the entire region of Chugoku and
    Shikoku. He was fearless. Mitsuru believed some people were destined
    for greatness. He thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>this
    guy is going to be someone so extraordinary I can't even imagine what
    he'll become.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    made him the leader of his gang, which continued to stir up trouble.
    Mitsuru only wondered once whether it was right to get Kazuo
    involved. Kazuo strictly prohibited (he never said so, but that was
    the vibe he gave off) Mitsuru and the others from visiting his house
    (in fact it was a mansion), so Mitsuru had no way of telling whether
    Kazuo's parents were aware of their son's activities. He was
    concerned his gang might be a bad influence on Kazuo, who was so
    obviously well bred. After thinking about it a lot, Mitsuru finally
    shared his concerns with Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Kazuo only said, &quot;I don't care. This is fun too.&quot; Mitsuru
    decided it was all right then.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    so, he and Kazuo had been through a lot together. The king and his
    loyal advisor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even
    though they were now in an extreme situation, this was why, while
    killing other classmates was possible, it was out of the question
    when it came to the members of the Kiriyama Family. After all, Kazuo
    himself had passed them notes. Mitsuru was certain Kazuo had already
    planned out a strategy to deal with this situation. He'd outwit
    Sakamochi, and then escape. If he really wanted to, Kazuo Kiriyama
    could take on the entire government, no prob.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These
    were Mitsuru's thoughts as he left the school and walked
    approximately twenty-five minutes southward. He saw only one person
    the whole time. The figure who vanished into the residential area
    southeast of the school was probably Yoji Kuramoto (Male Student No.
    8). That made Mitsuru nervous, of course. He'd already encountered
    the corpses of Mayumi Tendo and Yoshio Akamatsu lying outside the
    school when he left. The game was well on its way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru's
    priority was to get to the place assigned by Kazuo as soon as
    possible. The others were irrelevant. What mattered was how his group
    would escape from here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he moved south, Mitsuru became increasingly tense as any shelter he
    could hide behind grew sparse. Underneath his school uniform, his
    entire body was drenched in cold sweat. Sweat oozed out of his short,
    permed hair and dripped down his forehead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    little bit further ahead the coast curved right and left, and
    somewhere in the middle of this curve a rugged reef extended eastward
    from the hill and sank into the ocean like a buried dinosaur only
    revealing its back. The reef was much taller than Mitsuru, blocking
    his vision beyond it. Glancing at the sea, he saw islands and other
    small lights that indicated a larger piece of land beyond the dark,
    vast, horizontal expanse of water. This had to be an island in the
    Seto Inland Sea. That much was certain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    he surveyed the area, Mitsuru crossed the border between beach and
    woods. Exposing himself under moonlight, he walked toward the reef.
    He clung to the steep rock and began climbing. The rock was cold and
    smooth and with his right hand holding a gun and his bags strapped
    around his shoulders it wasn't an easy climb. After the climb, he
    found the reef was approximately three meters wide, and the beach
    spread out beyond the rocks. As he prepared to climb down the other
    side of the reef, a voice all of a sudden addressed him: &quot;Mitsuru.&quot;
    Mitsuru almost jumped. He turned around and raised his pistol.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    sighed with relief. Then he lowered his gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    Kiriyama was in the shadow of a bulging boulder. He was sitting on a
    protruding rock. &quot;Boss...&quot; Mitsuru said with relief.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But...&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    noticed three lumps lying at Kazuo's feet.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    eyes squinted in the dark... but then they immediately widened.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    lumps were humans.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    one facing up, glaring at the sky, was Ryuhei Sasagawa (Male Student
    No. 10). The one lying on his side, scrunched up, was Hiroshi
    Kuronaga (Male Student No. 9). It was undoubtedly them, the other
    members of the Kiriyama Family. The third one was wearing a sailor
    suit uniform, and because she was face down it was hard to tell, but
    she looked like Izumi Kanai (Female Student No. 5). And...there was a
    puddle under their bodies. It looked black, but Mitsuru knew of
    course what it was. If the sun were&nbsp;shining on them now, the
    color of this puddle would have been identical to the color of the
    national flag of the Republic of Greater East Asia—crimson red.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Completely
    confused, Mitsuru began to shiver. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What
    was...what was this?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    is the southern tip.&quot; Under his slicked-back hair, the
    perpetually calm eyes of Kazuo looked up at Mitsuru. He wore his coat
    over his shoulders like a boxer draped in his robe after a fight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wh-wh-wh-what—&quot;
    Mitsuru's trembling jaw made his voice shake. &quot;What's going on
    here—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    mean this?&quot; Kazuo nudged Ryuhei Sasagawa's body with the tip of
    his plain (but nice) straight-tip leather shoe. Ryuhei's right elbow,
    which had been resting on his chest, traced an arc and splashed into
    the puddle. His pinkie and ring finger disappeared into the puddle.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;They
    all tried to kill me. Kuronaga and Sasagawa...both. So I...killed
    them.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That
    can't be...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    couldn't believe it. Hiroshi Kuronaga was a nobody who tagged along
    with the group, so he was all the more loyal to Kazuo. Ryuhei
    Sasagawa was more arrogant, always putting up a front (sometimes it
    got to be a hassle to stop him from picking on Yoshio Akamatsu), but
    Ryuhei had been extremely grateful ever since Kazuo pulled some
    strings to stop the cops from arresting his younger brother for
    stealing. These two would have never betrayed Kazuo....</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    caught a whiff in the air. It was blood. The smell of blood. The odor
    was far more intense than the smell of Yoshitoki Kuninobu's blood
    back in the classroom. The difference was in the quantity. There was
    enough blood splashed around here to fill a bathtub.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Crushed
    by the smell, Mitsuru's trembling chin dropped. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Come
    to think of it...it was impossible to know what someone's true
    thoughts were. Maybe Hiroshi and Ryuhei were so afraid of being
    killed that they went nuts.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    In other words, they just couldn't deal with the pressure. They
    showed up here at the assigned location, but they tried to ambush
    Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Mitsuru's eyes were glued to the other corpse. Izumi Kanai, who was
    lying face down, was a cute, petite girl. She was the daughter of a
    town official (of course in this kind of ultra-centralized,
    bureaucratized society, being a town official or council person was
    just an honorary post without any influence), and although she wasn't
    in the same league as Kazuo she probably came from one of the five
    richest families in town. She wasn't stuck up at all, though, and
    Mitsuru thought she was kind of cute. Of course, given how different
    their backgrounds were, he wasn't stupid enough to get hung up over
    her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    now she was—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    somehow managed to say something. &quot;S-so boss, Izumi... how
    about...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo's
    calm, cold eyes stared at him. Intimidated by the look he gave him,
    Mitsuru searched for an answer on his own. &quot;So I-Izumi tried to
    kill you...too?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    nodded.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;She
    just happened to be here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    hesitated, but then forced himself to believe what he said. Well,
    maybe it was possible. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    mean, that's what the boss said</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    He spat out, &quot;I-I'm all right. I would never think of killing my
    boss. Th-this game is bullshit. We're going to take on Sakamochi and
    those bastards from the Special Defense Forces,&nbsp;right? I'm
    totally up for it—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course they couldn't approach the school now, because it was a
    forbidden zone. That's what Sakamochi said. But knowing Kazuo,
    Mitsuru was sure Kazuo had already come up with a plan.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    stopped speaking. He noticed Kazuo was shaking his head. Mitsuru
    moved his tongue, which had now turned gooey, and continued, &quot;Then
    we're escaping? All right then, we'll find a boat—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    said, &quot;Listen.&quot; Mitsuru stopped again.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    went on, &quot;I'm fine either way.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    Mitsuru clearly heard him, he kept on blinking. He didn't understand
    what Kazuo meant. He tried to read Kazuo's thoughts from the
    expression in his eyes, but they just calmly shone in the shadow over
    his face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wh-what
    do you mean, you're fine either way?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    lifted and pointed his chin at the night sky, as if he were
    stretching out his neck. The moon shone brightly and cast a gloomy
    shadow on Kazuo's well-defined face. He kept this pose and said, &quot;I
    sometimes lose track of what's right and wrong.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    was even more confused. That was when an entirely different thought
    occurred to him. Something was missing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    then he realized what it was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    Kiriyama Family consisted of Mitsuru, and Ryuhei and Hiroshi, whose
    bodies were lying there, plus Sho Tsukioka, who was missing. He'd
    left before Mitsuru. So then why...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course Sho Tsukioka might have lost his way. Or he might have been
    killed by someone else. But...Mitsuru felt the truth was more ominous
    than that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    went on, &quot;Like now. I just don't know.&quot; The sight of Kazuo
    going on like this seemed, strangely enough, sad.&nbsp;&quot;Anyway.&quot;
    Kazuo looked back at Mitsuru. Then, as if he were following a musical
    score that had suddenly switched to </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>allegro</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    he began speaking rapidly, as if it were beyond his control.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    came here. Izumi was here. Izumi tried to escape. I held her back.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    held his breath.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    when I tossed a coin. If it came up heads I'd take on Sakamochi
    and—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    finally understood, before Kazuo finished talking.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>No,
    it can't be...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    didn't want to believe it. It was unbelievable. Kazuo was the king
    and he was his loyal advisor. It was supposed to be about absolute,
    eternal loyalty and service. Even Kazuo's hairstyle. Right around the
    time Mitsuru's broken fingers healed up, he'd been the one who
    insisted on it to Kazuo. &quot;It looks good. You look so bad, boss.&quot;
    Kazuo kept the hairstyle after that. It was a silly little detail,
    but for Mitsuru it symbolized how close they were.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But,
    Mitsuru finally realized, maybe it was too much of a hassle for Kazuo
    to change his hairstyle. He might have been too preoccupied with
    other stuff to fuss over his hair. Then there were other things he
    realized. Mitsuru had firmly believed his relationship with Kazuo
    centered around a sacred team spirit, when in fact Kazuo might have
    just been in it for kicks or just &quot;just&quot;—yes, just an
    experience, just an experience to be had, no feelings attached to it
    whatsoever. Kazuo himself had once said, &quot;This is fun too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    of a sudden the one thing that had disturbed Mitsuru from early on
    returned with full force. Mitsuru thought it wasn't such a big deal,
    so he'd done his best to ignore it all this time: Kazuo Kiriyama
    never smiled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru's
    next thought might have been touching on the truth: </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>and
    it always seemed like a lot was going on in his head. Which was
    probably the case. But maybe there's something incredibly dark going
    on in Kazuo's mind, something so dark it's beyond my imagination?
    Maybe it isn't even something dark, maybe it's just an absence, a
    kind of black hole—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    maybe Sho Tsukioka had already sensed this about Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    had no more time to think. He was completely focused on his index
    finger (one of the fingers broken that fateful day) on the trigger of
    the Walther PPK in his right hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    sea breeze blew in, mixed in with the odor rising from the puddle of
    blood. The waves kept crashing in.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    Walther PPK in Mitsuru's hand quivered slightly— but the school
    coat draped over Kazuo's back was already moving by then.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a mildly pleasant rattling sound. Sure, it was different, but
    something about the pulse of 950 bullets ignited every minute
    resembled the tapping of an old manual typewriter you'd find in an
    antique store. Izumi Kanai, Ryuhei Sasagawa, and Hiroshi Kuronaga
    were all stabbed, so these were the first gunshots to echo through
    the island since the game began.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    was still standing. He couldn't see under his school uniform very
    clearly, but there were four finger-sized holes running from his
    chest down to his stomach. His back for some reason had two large
    can-sized holes. His right hand holding the Walther PPK was trembling
    by his waist. His eyes were staring up towards the North Star. But
    given how bright the moon was tonight, the star probably wasn't
    visible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    held a crude lump of metal resembling a tin dessert box with a
    handle. It was an Ingram M10 submachine gun. He said, &quot;If the
    coin came up tails, I decided I'd take part in the game.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if he'd been anticipating these words, Mitsuru crashed forward. As he
    fell, his head hit the rock and bounced back up five centimeters only
    once.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    Kiriyama sat still for a while. Then he got up and approached Mitsuru
    Numai's corpse. He gently touched the bullet ridden body with his
    left hand, as if checking for something.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    was no emotional response. He didn't feel anything, no guilt, no
    grief, no pity—not a single emotion.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    simply wanted to know how a human body reacted after it was shot. No,
    he merely thought, &quot;It might not be such a bad idea to know.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    removed his hand and touched his left temple—to be more accurate, a
    little further behind his temple. Any stranger would have thought he
    was merely straightening out his hair.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    that wasn't it. He did it because of a strange feeling he had—not
    pain, not an itch, but something elusive and infrequent, occurring
    only several times a year, when he'd reflexively touch the spot
    which, along with the feeling, became quite familiar to Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo's
    &quot;parents&quot; had provided him with a special education. But in
    spite of learning what there was to know about the world at such a
    young age, Kazuo himself had no idea what caused this feeling. It was
    inevitable. Any trace of the damage had almost completely disappeared
    by the time he was old enough to recognize himself in the mirror. In
    other words, he knew nothing: the fact that he'd almost died from a
    freak accident which caused the damage when he was still inside his
    mother's womb, of course, the fact that his mother was killed by the
    accident, the conversation his father and a highly reputed doctor had
    concerning the splinter digging into his skull right before his
    birth, the fact that neither his father nor the doctor who boasted
    the operation was a success knew that the splinter had gouged out a
    cluster of very fine nerve cells. Every one of these facts were from
    another time. The doctor died from liver failure, the father, or more
    accurately, &quot;his real father,&quot; also died from
    complications. So there was no one left to share these facts with
    Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One
    thing was absolutely certain—it was a given for Kazuo. Although he
    might not have particularly realized it, or more appropriately,
    perhaps because he was incapable of coming to such a realization,
    this was what it came down to: he, Kazuo Kiriyama, felt no emotion,
    no guilt, no sorrow, no pity, towards the four corpses, including
    Mitsuru's—and that ever since the day he was dropped into this
    world the way he was, he had never once felt a single emotion.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    the northern side of the island, opposite from where Kazuo and the
    others were, a steep cliff hung over the sea. It was over twenty
    meters high. On the cliff was a small field with a crown of wild
    grass. The waves crashed against the cliff and exploded into mist
    that drifted into the mild wind.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakura
    Ogawa (Female Student No. 4) and Kazuhiko Yamamoto (Male Student No.
    21) sat together at the edge of this cliff. Their legs hung over the
    edge. Sakura's right hand gently held Kazuhiko's left hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Their
    day packs and bags, along with their compasses, were scattered around
    them. Just as Kazuo had assigned the others to meet at the southern
    tip of the island, Sakura had scribbled &quot;at the northern tip&quot;
    on the piece of paper (right beside &quot;We shall kill each other&quot;)
    she passed on to Kazuhiko. At least they were lucky enough to meet
    somewhere that didn't coincide with Kazuo's meeting place. Despite
    their circumstances, they were lucky enough to spend some time alone.
    There was a Colt .357 Magnum tucked into Kazuhiko's belt, but he
    already knew he wouldn't be using it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    quiet,&quot; Sakura murmured. Beneath her hair, which was cut short
    for a girl, her pretty profile, beginning with her wide forehead,
    seemed to be forming a smile. She was tall, so she looked slim, and
    as always, she sat up straight. Kazuhiko had only recently arrived.
    As they hugged each other, her body trembled slightly like a wounded
    little bird.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    it is,&quot; Kazuhiko said. Aside from the bridge of his nose, which
    was slightly wide, he was good looking. He turned away from her to
    look at the view. The dark sea spread out under the moonlight, the
    black outlines of the islands scattered, and beyond them there was
    land. The lights were shining brightly on the islands and what
    appeared to be the Honshu mainland in the distance. It was a little
    before 3:30 a.m. In between those lights floating in the dark most
    people were sleeping peacefully. Or maybe there were kids like him
    studying late into the night for their high school entrance exams. It
    didn't look terribly far, but it was a world beyond their reach now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    confirmed the existence of the small black dot approximately two
    hundred meters out at sea. It appeared to be one of the ships &quot;there
    to kill anyone attempting to escape by sea&quot; that Sakamochi had
    mentioned. Although the Seto Inland Sea was always busy with boat
    traffic, even at night, not a single ship passed by to send out its
    lights. The government prohibited all traffic here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was chilling. Kazuhiko peeled his eyes off the black dot. He'd seen
    the corpses of Mayumi Tendo and Yoshio Akamatsu when he left the
    school. He also heard the sound of gunshots in the distance before he
    arrived here. The game had begun, and it would continue until the
    end. He and Sakura had already observed this, and this too no longer
    seemed to matter anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Thank
    you so much for this.&quot; Sakura was looking at the tiny bouquet of
    flowers in her left hand. On his way over here Kazuhiko had found
    several clover-like flowers which he then bundled together. At the
    top of the long, thin stems, the small petals were bunched together
    like a cheerleader's pom poms. They weren't the most impressive set
    of flowers, but this was all he could find.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    did his best to smile. &quot;Oh, you're very welcome.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakura
    looked down at the small bouquet, then finally said, &quot;So we'll
    never be able to go home together. We won't be able spend time
    together walking around town, eating ice cream, and doing anything
    else anymore.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakura
    interrupted Kazuhiko. &quot;It's futile to resist. I should know. I
    heard my father was against the government, and then one day...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    could tell from her hand that she was trembling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    police came and killed my father. No warrant, nothing. They just came
    in without a word and shot him dead. I can still remember it clearly.
    We were in the kitchen. I was still small. I was sitting at the
    table. My mother held me tight. Then I grew up and ate my meals at
    the same table.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakura
    turned to Kazuhiko.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    no use resisting.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was the first time she had ever told him about the incident, even
    though they'd been going out for two years. The first time they slept
    together, just a month ago at her house, she hadn't mentioned it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    felt there must be something else to say, but all he could muster up
    struck him as incredibly trite. &quot;Wow, that must have been hard.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Sakura broke into a smile. &quot;You're so kind, Kazuhiko. You're so
    kind. That's what I like about you.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    like you too. I love you so much.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If
    he weren't so inarticulate, Kazuhiko could have said so much more.
    How much her expressions, her words, her gentle manner, and untainted
    pure soul meant to him.&nbsp;How important, in short, her existence
    was to him. But he wasn't able to put it in words. He was only a
    third-year student in junior high, and worse yet, composition was one
    of his worst subjects.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well.&quot;
    Sakura closed her eyes and took in a deep breath, as if a little
    relieved. Then she breathed out. &quot;I really wanted to make sure I
    saw you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she went on. &quot;Horrible things are going to happen. No—according
    to what you said, they've already begun. Just yesterday we were all
    friends—and now we're going to kill each other.&quot; Putting this
    thought into words, she trembled again. Again Kazuhiko could tell
    from her hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakura
    gave him a weary smile that betrayed fear along with the terrible
    irony of the fate awaiting them. &quot;I couldn't take that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course not. Sakura was kind. Kazuhiko didn't know anyone else kinder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Besides,&quot;
    Sakura spoke again, &quot;we can't go back together. Even if by some
    miracle one of us could go back, we still wouldn't be together. Even
    if...even if I were to survive...I couldn't bear being without you.
    So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakura
    stopped. Kazuhiko understood what she was getting at. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>So
    I'm going to kill myself here. Before anyone gets me. Right in front
    of you.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Instead
    of finishing what she had to say, she said, &quot;But you have to
    live.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    smiled grimly, then squeezed her hand tightly and shook his head. &quot;No
    way. I'm with you. Even if I were to survive, I couldn't stand being
    without you. Don't leave me alone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tears
    came streaming out of Sakura's eyes which were fixed on Kazuhiko's
    eyes.&nbsp;Sakura turned away from Kazuhiko. Wiping her eyes with her
    left hand that was holding the bouquet of clovers, all of a sudden
    she blurted out, &quot;Did you see the final episode of </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Tonight,
    at the Same Place</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    which airs every Thursday night at nine?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    nodded. It was a TV drama broadcast by the national DBS network. It
    was a superfluous love story produced by the Republic of Greater East
    Asia Television Network, but it was quite good, topping TV ratings
    for the last several years.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    I saw it. You wanted me to watch it.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,
    I did. So what I was thinking...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she spoke, Kazuhiko thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>this
    is exactly how we'd always talk. It was always about something really
    ordinary and meaningless, but there was something so blissful about
    these conversations they had. Sakura wants us to stay the way we've
    always been.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    thought suddenly made Kazuhiko want to cry.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    I was all right about the two main characters ending up together.
    That's how it's supposed to be. But I don't know about Miki's friend
    Mizue, the one played by Anna Kitagawa. How could Mizue have given up
    on the guy she loved? I know I would have gone after him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    grinned. &quot;I knew you'd say that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakura
    laughed bashfully. &quot;I can't hide anything from you.&quot; Then
    she said happily, &quot;I still remember when we became classmates in
    junior high. You were tall and good looking, sure, but the thing that
    really got me was how I thought, 'This guy would understand me, he
    would understand me down to the core of my heart.' &quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know how to say this very well but...&quot; Kazuhiko twisted
    his tongue a little and thought for a moment, then continued, &quot;I
    think I felt the same way.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    said it well.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he leaned over a little, towards Sakura. With his left hand still
    clutching her right hand, he wrapped his other hand around her
    shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    hugged in this position and exchanged kisses. Was it just a few
    seconds? Was it a minute? Or was it eternity?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    any case, the kiss ended. They heard a rustling sound. They sensed
    someone in the bushes behind them. That was their signal: all aboard.
    The train is departing, so you better get on board.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    had nothing left to say. They could have fought against the intruder.
    He could have taken his gun and aimed it at the person behind them.
    But she wouldn't want that. What she wanted was to leave this world
    quietly before they got sucked into this horrible massacre. Nothing
    was more important to him than her. There was no room for compromise.
    If this was what her trembling soul wanted, then he would follow her.
    Had he been more eloquent he might have described his feelings as
    something like, &quot;I'm going to die for her honor.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Their
    two bodies danced in the air beyond the cliff, the black sea in the
    background, their hands still clasped together.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    Utsumi (Female Student No. 2) poked her head out from the bushes a
    little. She held her breath and watched them. She had no intention
    whatsoever of harming anyone, so she had no idea that the noise she
    made signaled their departure. She was simply stunned by the sight of
    the No. 1 couple in class vanishing beyond the grassy cliff. The
    sound of waves quietly brushing up against the sheer rock face
    continued and the small clovers Sakura dropped remained lying on the
    grass.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even
    when Haruka Tanizawa (Female Student No. 12) approached her from

    stood there trembling.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    Eto (Female Student No. 3) sat in the dark, hugging her knees while
    her small body shook violently. She was inside a house slightly
    removed from the island's most populated area on the eastern shore.
    The lights might have worked, but Megumi didn't dare try them. The
    moonlight coming through the window didn't reach under the worn out
    kitchen table she was hiding under. It was almost pitch black, so she
    couldn't check her watch, but two hours had probably passed since she
    sat down here. It was probably almost 4 a.m. Was it one hour since
    she heard that distant, faint sound that sounded like firecrackers?
    No, Megumi didn't even want to think about what that really was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    raised her face and saw, silhouetted against the moonlight, the
    cupboard and kettle right above the sink. She was aware the
    government probably relocated the island's residents to some
    temporary housing units, but the remaining traces of someone's life
    in this house was unnatural and creepy. It reminded her of the ghost
    story she'd heard as a child, about the ship </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Marie
    Celeste</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    whose entire crew suddenly vanished into thin air, leaving behind
    their meals and possessions in mid-use. She became even more
    terrified.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Immediately
    after her departure she had no idea where she was headed. Next thing
    she knew she was in the middle of this residential area. The first
    thought that occurred to her was that there weren't too many students
    out yet. She was the sixth to leave the school. Five were already
    out...but only five. There were&nbsp;fifty or sixty houses in this
    area, so the chances of encountering one of them were close to nil.
    And as long as she locked the door and kept the place to herself...
    then she would be safe at least until she had to move. The collar
    that would explode if she remained in one of the forbidden zones was
    oppressive, but there was nothing she could do about it. Sakamochi
    had warned that, &quot;If you try to pry it loose, it will explode.&quot;
    In any case, the important thing was to make sure she could hear
    Sakamochi's announcement of the time and location of each forbidden
    zone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    Megumi had tried to enter a house, but the first one was locked. So
    was the second one. She went to the backyard of the third one and
    broke the sash window with a rock she found on the ground. It made
    such a huge sound, she ducked under the veranda. No one seemed to be
    in the area, though. She entered. There was no use locking the sash
    now. She had to laboriously close the storm door. Once it was shut,
    the inside turned pitch black, and she felt as if she'd wandered into
    a haunted house. She managed to pull out her flashlight though and
    searched the house. She took two fishing poles and used them to jam
    the storm door shut.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    now she was under the kitchen table. Killing each other was out of
    the question. But what if... just what if this area (checking the
    map, she found the whole area was almost completely inside sector
    H=8) never turned into a forbidden zone, then she might end up
    surviving.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But...</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Megumi
    continued shaking as she continued to think. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That
    was terrible. Of course...according to the rules of the game,
    everyone was your enemy so you couldn't trust anyone</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    That's why she was shaking right now...but, but even if the game
    ended and she turned out to be the sole survivor, then that would
    also mean everyone else had died: her friends (like Mizuho Inada and
    Kaori Minami), as well as Shuya Nanahara, who made her heart flutter
    every time she thought of him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    pulled her knees in and thought of Shuya in the dark. What she really
    loved about him was his voice. That slight rasp that was neither too
    high nor too low. He apparently loved censored music called &quot;rock,&quot;
    so he always looked really unhappy in music class when they had to
    sing songs praising the government and the Dictator, but he sang
    incredibly. The sound from his guitar when he played improvised
    passages was superb. Its unfamiliar rhythm made you want to dance.
    And yet there was also something graceful about the sound, not unlike
    the sound of bells chiming in a beautiful church. And then there was
    his longish permed hair (Shuya once said, &quot;I'm imitating Bruce
    Springsteen,&quot; but Megumi had no idea what he was talking about),
    not to mention his slightly drowsy looking, kind eyes with double
    eyelids. Also he moved so gracefully since he'd been a star Little
    League player ever since elementary school.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    shaking subsided a little when she thought of Shuya's face and voice.
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh,
    if only Shuya Nanahara were with me right now, it would be so
    wonderful...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    then, why didn't she ever tell Shuya how she felt about him? By love
    letter? Or by sending someone to bring him, so she could confess to
    him directly? Or by phone? Now she'd never get the chance.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That's
    when it occurred to her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    phone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
    right. Sakamochi said we wouldn't be able to use phones in the
    houses. But...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    grabbed her nylon bag, which was lying next to her supplied day pack.
    She pulled open the zipper and shoved aside her clothes and personal
    effects.&nbsp;She touched a hard square object and grabbed it.&nbsp;It
    was a cell phone. Her mother bought it for her for this trip in case
    something (well, this wasn't just </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>something</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)
    happened during her trip. It was true she'd been envious of the other
    one or two classmates who owned one, and there was something
    thrilling about the feeling of having your own private link, but
    Megumi also thought her parents were being overprotective, and that
    her mother was neurotic. She wondered, &quot;</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Why
    would a junior high school kid need this?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;
    when she put the shiny phone into her bag. She'd completely forgotten
    about it until this very moment.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    flipped open the phone with her trembling hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    phone automatically switched from receive mode to send mode and the
    small LCD panel and dial buttons lit up with a green glow. Her knees
    under her skirt and bags were now visible. But more importantly,
    there, without a doubt, was the antenna and air wave symbols lighting
    up on the display panel, indicating it was ready for a phone call!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh...God...&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    frantically pressed the dial buttons, the numbers for her home in
    Shiroiwa-cho. 0, 8, 7, 9, 2...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    a moment of silence, the phone on the other end began to ring in her
    ear, and her chest filled with hope.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One,
    two, three rings. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Please
    answer it. Dad, Mom. I might be calling at an unreasonable hour, but
    you must be aware your daughter is in an emergency situation. Hurry!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    ringing was interrupted by a voice answering, &quot;Hello.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh
    Dad!&quot; In her cramped position Megumi closed her eyes. She
    thought she would go crazy from relief. I'm going to be saved. Saved!
    &quot;Dad, it's me! Megumi! Oh Dad! Please help me! Please, save me
    from here!&quot; She shouted into the phone in a frenzy, but she came
    to herself because there was no response. Something...was wrong.
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What...why
    won't Dad...? No, this was...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally,
    the voice at the other end spoke, &quot;I'm not your dad, Megumi.
    This is Sakamochi. I told you the phones wouldn't work, Megumi.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    shrieked and tossed the phone to the floor. Then she hurriedly
    slammed the &quot;END&quot; button.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    heart thumped frantically. Once again Megumi was overcome with
    despair. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh,
    no...so it failed...so I am going to die here... I'm going to die...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then Megumi's heart leaped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	...it
    was a shattering sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    sound of broken glass.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    turned towards the origin of the sound. It came from the sitting room
    which she had checked to make sure it was locked. Someone was coming.
    Someone. Why, though? Of all the houses here, why this one?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    panicked and closed the cell phone panel, which had been still
    glowing green. She put it in her pocket, took the weapon from her day
    pack, and pulled the double-bladed diver's knife from its plastic
    sheath. She gripped it tightly. She had to escape as quickly as
    possible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    her body was frozen and she couldn't move. Megumi slowed her
    breathing. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Please,
    please, please&nbsp;God, make sure they can't hear my pounding heart.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    heard the sound of a window opening, then closing, then the sound of
    careful, quiet footsteps. They seemed to be moving around the house,
    but then they headed directly towards the kitchen and Megumi.
    Megumi's heart pounded even louder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    thin ray of light shot through the kitchen. The ray glided over the
    kettle and cupboard above the sink. Someone sighed with relief and
    said to herself, &quot;Good, there's no one here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    footsteps entered the kitchen. As soon as Megumi heard the voice,
    though, Megumi was aghast. Any minuscule hope that she could work
    something out in case the intruder turned out to be a friend had been
    completely shattered. Because...it was the voice of her, Mitsuko
    Souma (Female Student No. 11), the meanest girl in the entire school.
    Even though she had the cutest, most angelic face, a single glance
    from her was enough to intimidate any teacher.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    Souma was more frightening to Megumi than any of the ill-reputed
    boys, Kazuo Kiriyama and Shogo Kawada. It might have been because,
    like Megumi, Mitsuko Souma was a girl, and also, yes of course,
    because Megumi herself had been harassed by Hirono Shimizu, who was
    in Mitsuko's gang, when they first became classmates in second-year.
    If they were in the same hall, Hirono would trip her or slash her
    skirt with a razor. Lately, maybe because she'd simply lost interest
    in Megumi, Hirono had stopped harassing her. (She was still
    disappointed though when she learned that her third-year class was to
    be the same as her second-year class.) Mitsuko herself didn't pick on
    Megumi, but Mitsuko was someone even Hirono couldn't defy.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    Souma would relish killing someone like her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi's
    body began trembling again. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh,
    please no, don't shake. If she hears me...</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Megumi
    wrapped her body tightly with her arms to keep her arms from shaking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From
    beneath the table Megumi could see Mitsuko's hand holding a
    flashlight and the belt of her skirt glowing behind it. She heard the
    sound of Mitsuko rifling through the drawers of the sink.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	BRRRRIING.
    The electronic signal rang, and Megumi felt her heart leap out of her
    mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    Souma also seemed to quiver, slightly. The beam from her flashlight
    suddenly disappeared along with the belt. She seemed to be
    approaching the corner of the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    realized the sound was coming from her pocket.&nbsp;She frantically
    pulled out the cellular. Her mind went blank and she automatically
    flipped it open and randomly pressed the buttons.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    voice leaked out, &quot;Hey, it's Sakamochi again. I just wanted to
    remind you, Megumi, to turn off your cell phone. Otherwise, if I call
    you like this, everyone will know where you are, right? So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi's
    fingers found the &quot;End&quot; button, cutting off Sakamochi's
    voice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    suffocating silence continued for a while. Then she heard Mitsuko's
    voice, &quot;Megumi?&quot; She asked, &quot;Megumi? Is that you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    seemed to be in the corner of the dark kitchen. Megumi carefully
    placed her cell phone on the floor. The only thing in her hands now
    was her knife. Her hands were shaking even more, and the knife felt
    like a fish wiggling loose, but she gripped it as tight as she could.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    was taller than Megumi, but she couldn't have been much stronger.
    Mitsuko's weapon—could it possibly be a gun?—no, then Mitsuko
    would have aimed it over here and fired. If Mitsuko didn't have a
    gun—then Megumi might have a chance.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes,
    she had to kill. If she didn't kill, Mitsuko would surely kill her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    had to kill.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a clicking sound, and once again the flashlight beam appeared. It
    lit up the bottom of the table, and Megumi squinted for an instant.
    Now was the time—all she had to do was get up, run toward the
    source of the light with her knife out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Megumi's intentions were about to be abruptly undermined by an
    unexpected turn of events.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    flashlight beam fell on a lower spot, and Mitsuko Souma sank down on
    the floor into the light, staring at Megumi. Tears were streaming
    down Mitsuko's cheeks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    so glad...&quot; her trembling lips finally parted, and she managed
    to say in a feeble voice, &quot;I'm...I'm...I'm so
    scared....&quot;&nbsp;Mitsuko's voice was half shrieking. She thrust
    both of her hands forward as if seeking Megumi's protection. Her
    hands were empty.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she continued, &quot;I can trust you, right? I can trust you. You
    wouldn't think of killing me, would you? You'll stay with me, won't
    you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    was stunned. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>This
    was Mitsuko Souma crying. She's asking for my help. Oh...</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">as
    the shaking in her body subsided, Megumi felt an indescribable
    emotion well up inside her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    that's how it was. It didn't matter how bad her reputation was,
    Mitsuko Souma was just another third-year junior high school student
    like her. Even Mitsuko Souma couldn't take part in something as
    horrible as killing other classmates. She was just lonely and scared
    out of her wits.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>And...oh,
    how terrible, I'd actually considered it. I thought of killing her.&nbsp;</i></font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    so...I'm so horrible.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    burst into tears, overwhelmed by self-loathing along with the
    security that she now felt she was no longer alone, she was with
    someone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    knife slipped through Megumi's hands. She crawled on the floor,
    emerged from under the table, and held Mitsuko's offered hands. As if
    a dam inside her were bursting, she blurted out, &quot;Mitsuko!
    Mitsuko!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    knew she was shaking this time from a different kind of emotion. It
    didn't matter.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    all right. I'll stay with you. We'll stay together.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;
    Mitsuko scrunched up her tear-stained face and squeezed Megumi's
    hands in return, nodding and repeating, &quot;Uh-huh, uh-huh.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    held Mitsuko like this on the kitchen floor. She felt the warmth of
    Mitsuko's body and she felt all the more guilty as her arms felt
    Mitsuko's body trembling helplessly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I-I
    was really thinking of doing something horrible...so horrible...I was
    actually trying to kill this girl...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey...&quot;
    Megumi began to blurt out, &quot;I-I...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hm?&quot;
    Mitsuko lifted her teary eyes up to Megumi.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    pursed her lips tightly to stifle a shriek and shook her head. &quot;I-I'm
    so ashamed of myself. For a moment, I was trying to kill you. I
    thought of killing you. Because I was...1 was so scared.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko's
    eyes widened when she heard this—but she didn't get upset. All she
    did was slightly nod her face which had been scrunched up from crying
    hysterically. Then she offered a warm smile. &quot;That's okay.
    Really. Don't get too upset. It's only to be expected. In this awful
    situation. Really, don't get upset. Okay? Just stay with me, please?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    Mitsuko said this, she gently held Megumi's face with her left hand
    and pressed her left cheek against Megumi's cheek. Megumi could feel
    Mitsuko's tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Megumi thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    was so wrong about her</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    It turned out Mitsuko Souma was an incredibly kind girl. She managed
    to forgive someone who tried to kill her with such a kind response,
    &quot;It's okay.&quot; Didn't our teacher, Mr. Hayashida, who's
    already been killed, warn us how wrong it is to judge people just by
    their reputations?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    these thoughts, Megumi felt something well up inside her again. She
    held Mitsuko's body even more tightly. That was all she could do for
    now. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    so sorry, I'm so sorry, I am such a horrible person, I am really</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    slashing sound Megumi heard sounded like a lemon being cut.&nbsp;It
    was a nice sound. The knife must have been really sharp and the lemon
    fresh, the way they are on television cooking shows, as in, &quot;Today,
    we'll be cooking lemon salmon.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    took her a few seconds to realize what had occurred.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    saw Mitsuko's right hand. On the left side under her chin. Her hand
    held a gently curved, banana-shaped blade that reflected dully
    against the flashlight beam. It was a sickle—the kind used to
    harvest rice. And now its tip was stuck in Megumi's throat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    left hand clutching the back of Megumi's head, Mitsuko dug the sickle
    in further. It made another crunching noise.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi's
    throat began to burn, but it didn't last very long. She couldn't say
    a word and lost consciousness as her chest warmed over with blood.
    She expired, unable to form any idea of what it meant exactly to have
    a blade stuck in her throat. Betrayed in the arms of Mitsuko, she
    died without any thoughts concerning Shuya Nanahara or her family.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    let go of Megumi, who collapsed onto the floor right beside her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    quickly turned off her flashlight and stood up. She wiped away the
    annoying tears (which she could produce any time. It was in fact one
    of her special talents). Holding the sickle in her right hand up to
    the moonlight, she whipped the blood off onto the floor. The blood
    drops made a splattering sound against the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Not
    bad for starters</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Mitsuko thought. She was hoping for a knife that was easier to use,
    but it turned out a sickle wasn't so bad. She hadn't been careful
    enough though in entering a house that might already be occupied.
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>From
    now on I'll have to be more careful.&nbsp;Looking down at Megumi's
    corpse, she spoke slowly and quietly, &quot;I'm sorry. I was also
    trying to kill you.&quot;</i></font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    Nanahara looked up and watched the blue sky gradually turning white
    through the thicket. The branches and leaves of oak, camellia, some
    kind of cherry, and other kinds of trees wove an intricate net around
    them and hid them.</font></font><br/>
    <br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized several things as he reexamined the map. The island was
    roughly diamond shaped. The hills rose upward on the south and north
    end of the island. They were now located at the south side of the
    northern mountain, near the slope on its west side. According to the
    map coordinates, the location seemed to be in sector C-4. Along with
    contour lines, the map was detailed, including the residential area
    and other houses (indicated by light blue dots), various buildings
    (there wasn't much besides symbols indicating a medical clinic, a
    fire station, and a lighthouse—and then a town hall, a fishermen's
    coop, that was about it), and roads small and large, allowing him to
    check where each area was according to the positions of land
    formations, roads, and scattered houses.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    night he'd already confirmed as soon as they were higher up the hill
    that the map faithfully represented this island. Silhouettes of
    islands, large and small, were scattered across the black sea—and
    as Sakamochi had said, there was (almost exactly west of the island)
    the silhouette of what appeared to be a guard ship with its lights
    turned off.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Immediately
    west of where Shuya and Noriko were, the grove ended abruptly and was
    replaced by a steep slope. There was a small field below, and beyond
    it the slope continued on toward the ocean. There was a small shack
    with a raised floor in the middle of the field that they had passed
    through last night. Seeing the worn out wooden Shinto archway ten
    meters away from the shack, Shuya assumed it was a shrine (which was
    also marked on the map).&nbsp;The front door was open, and there was
    no one inside.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just
    as he had with the other houses, Shuya decided against hiding in this
    shrine. There might be others doing the same thing...and given how
    there was only one entrance, they'd be trapped the moment they were
    found.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    settled on a place surrounded by shrubbery relatively near the sea,
    where they could lie down and rest. Higher up the hill the shrubbery
    seemed thicker, but he thought that would also attract others, and in
    case they met someone who turned out to be an enemy, he thought they
    were better off somewhere not too steep, where it was hard to run.
    After all Noriko's leg was injured.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    sat down against a tree, which was approximately ten centimeters
    wide. Noriko sat immediately to&nbsp;his left. She leaned against the
    tree, her injured right leg limply stretched out. They were
    completely exhausted by now. Noriko slowly closed her eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    discussed their course of action with Noriko, but they couldn't come
    up with much.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    first thought of finding a boat to escape from the island. But he
    immediately realized how futile that'd be. There was a guard ship out
    at sea and furthermore—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    slowly reached for his neck and touched the cold surface of &quot;that
    thing.&quot; He'd gotten used to the sensation, but it felt heavy, as
    if it were their inescapable fate itself, choking out their
    existence.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes—that
    collar.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    a special signal is transmitted from the school, the bomb inside the
    collar explodes. According to rules this would happen to anyone
    caught in a forbidden zone, but of course the same would apply to
    anyone attempting to escape by sea. In fact these collars rendered
    those guard ships unnecessary. Even if they managed to find a boat,
    it was impossible for them to escape as long as these collars were on
    their necks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    only way out was for them to attack Sakamochi at the school and
    disable the collar locks. But even with that, the G-7 sector where
    the school was located had become a forbidden zone since the game
    started, so it was impossible to approach it. Besides, their
    locations were constantly being monitored.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    continued to think this through while the area was lit up by morning.
    It would be dangerous for them to move in the sunlight. He thought
    they should wait again for nightfall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    here again there was another problem, the time limit. &quot;If no one
    dies within twenty-four hours.&quot; The last time Shuya saw someone
    die was when he left the school, which was over three hours ago. If
    everyone remained alive, in a little more than twenty hours everyone
    would be dead. Even if they made an attempt to escape, by nightfall
    it might be too late to get their act together. Ironically, more
    classmates dying would buy them more time to survive. Shuya tried to
    shake this thought off.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were trapped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    kept on wishing, if only they could meet up with Shinji Mimura. With
    his wide range of knowledge and accompanying broad expertise to apply
    it, a guy like Shinji could come up with a solution to their
    situation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    also kept on regretting not taking the risk of waiting for Shinji
    after Yoshio Akamatsu's attack. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Did
    I really do the right thing? Would I have been attacked as an enemy
    there? Maybe Yoshio Akamatsu had been the only exception.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No...that
    wasn't necessarily true. There might be a lot more &quot;enemies.&quot;
    It was impossible to determine who your enemy was in the first place.
    Who was still normal and who wasn't anymore? </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But—maybe
    we're the ones who aren't being normal anymore? Maybe we're insane?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt like he was going crazy.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was Sakamochi's voice. The speakers were impossible to locate, but
    his voice came through loud and clear, aside from some metallic
    distortion. The speakers were probably installed not only in the

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's

    Yoshio's name also meant&nbsp;more to Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshio
    Akamatsu wasn't dead at that moment. Then— was he killed in an
    attempt to kill someone else? Or, no, did he remain unconscious,
    lying there...and then blown to bits by this nice collar we're
    wearing because the school was now a &quot;forbidden zone&quot;?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Regardless,
    the fact that Shuya had knocked him out didn't make him feel very
    good. This line of thought immediately evaporated though, with the
    announcement of other names of the dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Next,
    No. 9 Hiroshi Kuronaga, No. 10 Ryuhei Sasagawa, No. 17 Mitsuru Numai,

    Megumi Eto, No. 4 Sakura Ogawa, No. 5 Izumi Kanai, No. 14 Mayumi
    Tendo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    list of names meant that their chances of survival were slightly
    increased, but this thought didn't even occur to Shuya. He felt
    dizzy. The faces of his dead classmates drifted through his head and
    disappeared. They were all killed, which meant that there were
    killers out there. Unless some of them had committed suicide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was continuing. The game was undeniably in progress. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>A

    Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa? You two, that's right, you're a
    little early. But you did just pass by your own graves right here. We
    carved in the number you two share, No. 15. Don't worry, we're

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko's location wasn't in Sakamochi's forbidden zones.
    Sakamochi claimed the zones were randomly selected. In any case,
    they'd made the right move avoiding the residential area. But their
    location could be included in the next announcement.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sakura
    and...&quot; As Noriko spoke, Shuya turned to her. &quot;Sakura and
    Kazuhiko's names were mentioned.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah...&quot;
    Shuya moaned deep down in his throat. &quot;I wonder if...they killed
    themselves.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked down at her feet. &quot;I don't know. But they must have been
    together, knowing those two,&nbsp;until the very end. They somehow
    managed to meet each other.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had seen Sakura pass a note to Kazuhiko. He and Noriko were only
    making hopeful observations, though. For all they knew, the two might
    have been killed separately, in separate places by insane classmates.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dismissing
    the image of her slipping the note to him as their hands touched,
    Shuya pulled out his student list from his pocket. It came with the
    map in the day pack. It was in bad taste, but he had to mark the
    information down. He took out his pen, and then as he was about to
    cross out the names—he decided not to. It was just too...it was
    just too awful.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Instead
    he entered a small check mark by the names. He also included
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu and Fumiyo Fujiyoshi. Shuya felt like he was
    turning into the man in the black suit from the vision he just had.
    &quot;Let's see, you, and also you. And you. What's your coffin size?

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Enough.
    In any case, three out of four of Kazuo Kiriyama's gang are dead.
    Hiroshi Kuronaga, Ryuhei Sasagawa, and Mitsuru Numai. The only ones
    who weren't mentioned were Sho Tsukioka—nicknamed &quot;Zuki.&quot;
    He was a little weird. And Kazuo Kiriyama himself.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    recalled Mitsuru Numai's smug face when Kazuo Kiriyama left the
    classroom. Shuya had assumed Kazuo would organize his gang and
    attempt an escape. So what did these results mean? Maybe, even though
    they'd agreed to meet somewhere, they turned suspicious and turned
    against each other? Then Sho Tsukioka and Kazuo managed to
    escape—would that mean Sho Tsukioka and Kazuo were still together?
    No, something completely different might have happened. Shuya had no
    idea.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he recalled the faint sound of guns going off. He'd only heard it
    once. If that had been gunfire—then which one of these ten did it
    kill?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    thoughts were interrupted all of a sudden by a rustling sound.
    Noriko's face stiffened. Shuya immediately stuck the pen and list
    into his pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    listened closely. The sound continued. In fact, it was approaching
    them.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    whispered to Noriko, &quot;Be quiet.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    grabbed his day pack. They had to be able to move at any moment, so
    he'd put everything he needed in it. He left some of his clothes in
    his sports bag, but it wasn't a big deal to toss it. Noriko had also
    packed her bags the same way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    hoisted the two day packs on his left shoulder. He offered Noriko his
    hands to help her up. They waited in a crouched position.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pulled out his knife. His right hand held it in a reverse grip. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rustling became increasingly louder. It was probably only a few
    meters away.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was overwhelmed by the same tension he felt outside the school. He
    held Noriko's shoulder with his left hand and pulled her back. He
    stood up and stepped back. The sooner the better. As soon as
    possible!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    made their way through the bushes and came out onto a foot trail. It
    winded up the hill. Trees loomed above them, branches bunched
    together, and the sky was blue.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    holding Noriko, Shuya treaded backwards with her for several meters
    along the trail. The rustling sound continued in the bushes they'd
    just left. The sound grew and then—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    eyes widened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    white cat jumped out of the bushes and landed on the trail. It was
    scraggly, and its hair was frayed, but in any case, that's what it
    was—a cat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko looked at each other. &quot;It's a cat,&quot; she said and
    broke into a smile. Shuya also grinned. Then the cat turned to them
    as if it had finally noticed them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    stared at them for a while and then ran up to them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    returned his knife into the sheath while Noriko crouched, cautiously
    bent her injured leg, and offered her hands to the cat. The cat
    jumped into her hands and nuzzled her feet. Noriko slipped her hands
    under the cat's front feet and hugged it towards her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Poor
    kitty. Look how thin it is.&quot; Noriko said as she pursed her lips
    towards the cat as if to kiss it. The cat responded enthusiastically,
    purring, meow.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It
    must be a domestic cat. It's so friendly.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    government had relocated all the residents of this island for the
    sake of this game. (Because the Program was a secret operation until
    it was over, they must not have been informed.) As Noriko said, maybe
    this cat had been owned by someone here and abandoned after its owner
    left. There weren't any houses in the area, so did it get lost in the
    hills? Shuya wondered as he casually looked away from Noriko. He
    turned...</font></font></p>

    shock.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was someone wearing a school coat ten meters away, standing on the
    trail as if his feet were glued to it. Although he was of medium
    height, like Shuya, he had a solid build from his training on the
    handball team. His skin was tanned, and he had a buzz cut. His hair
    stood up at the front. It was Tatsumichi Oki (Male Student No. 3).</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    followed Shuya's eyes and turned around. Her face suddenly grew
    tense. What was going on with Tatsumichi? Was he an enemy or not?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tatsumichi
    Oki stood there, staring at them. Shuya felt his field of vision grow
    narrow from the tension—the way it might in a speeding car—but in
    the corner of his eye he could still make out the large hatchet in
    Tatsumichi's right hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    reflexively raised his hand to the knife tucked in his belt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    set it off. Tatsumichi's hand, the one holding the hatchet, twitched,
    and then he began running towards them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shoved Noriko, who was still holding the cat, into the bushes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tatsumichi
    was already right in front of him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    quickly lifted up his day pack. The hatchet went right into it,
    splitting it open so its contents spilled to the ground. Water
    sprayed out of the bag from the broken water bottle. The blade
    reached Shuya's arm. A searing pain ran under his skin.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    tossed down the torn day pack and leaped back to gain some distance.
    Tatsumichi's face was so wound up the whites of his eyes formed
    circles around his pupils.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    couldn't believe it. Yes, they were in a dire situation, and Shuya
    had been for a moment suspicious too, but how could he?...How could
    that cheerful, nice guy, Tatsumichi, do such a thing?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tatsumichi
    quickly glanced over to where Noriko was, in the bushes. Following
    his gaze, Shuya looked over at Noriko too. Noriko's face and lips
    froze at Tatsumichi's glance. The cat had already gone off elsewhere.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    Tatsumichi turned to Shuya and swung his hatchet sideways.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    met the blow with the knife he'd pulled out from his belt.
    Unfortunately it was still inside its leather sheath, but in any
    case, there was a locking sound. He managed to stop the blow about
    five centimeters away from his cheek. Shuya could see the blue ripple
    on the hatchet blade, probably formed when it had been forged.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    Tatsumichi could swing back, Shuya tossed his knife out and grabbed
    Tatsumichi's right arm, which was holding the hatchet. But Tatsumichi
    forced a swing, which although slow managed to hit the right side of
    Shuya's head. Some of the slightly wavy long hair above his right ear
    fell, and a sharp tear ran through his earlobe. It didn't hurt much.
    A silly, inappropriate thought crossed his mind: </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>well,
    it's no big deal, Shinji had his pierced, after all.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tatsumichi
    switched the hatchet from his right hand to his left but before he
    could swing at Shuya again, Shuya swept his left leg under
    Tatsumichi's feet. Tatsumichi's legs swayed, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>all
    right now, fall!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he managed to stay up, teetered, and then spun around. He fell on top
    of Shuya. Shuya moved back into the shrubbery. The sound of crushed
    branches surrounded them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    continued moving back. Forced by Tatsumichi's awesome strength, he
    was now practically running backwards. Noriko's face was vanishing
    from his sight. In this unreal situation, another absurd thought
    crossed his mind. He recalled Little League practice. Shuya Nanahara,
    backwards-running champion, yeah!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    his feet felt funny.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    suddenly recalled how there was a steep slope towards the field with
    the shrine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    falling!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    two of them tumbled down the slope covered with shrubbery. The clear
    early morning sky and greenery spun around and around. But he still
    managed to hold onto Tatsumichi's wrist.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt as if they'd fallen from a great height, but it was probably
    only ten meters or so. Their bodies crashed with a loud thump, and
    they were still. The area was bathed in sunlight. They'd fallen into
    the field.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was crushed under Tatsumichi. He had to get up before Tatsumichi
    could.&nbsp;But that was when Shuya felt something strange. Although
    Tatsumichi had come at him with the force of an air compressor, the
    strength in his arms had completely gone. They'd gone limp.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    face under the lower part of Tatsumichi's chest, Shuya saw why, as he
    looked up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    above him, the hatchet was lodged into Tatsumichi's face. Half of the
    blade stuck out from his face like the top layer of chocolate on a
    Christmas cake. The hatchet had landed on his forehead, neatly split
    open the left eyeball (a gooey liquid leaked out with his blood), and
    a pale blue light reflected off the blade inside his mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tatsumichi
    still held onto the hatchet, but Shuya was the one holding his
    wrists. Shuya felt a horrible sensation running at the speed of light
    from Tatsumichi's face to his wrists.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if tracing the course of this sensation, blood slid down the blade,
    flowing from Tatsumichi onto Shuya's hands holding Tatsumichi's
    wrists. Shuya let out a low groan, released his hands, and got out
    from underneath Tatsumichi's body. Tatsumichi's body rolled over,
    face up, his horrific dead face thrust into the morning light.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Huffing
    and puffing, Shuya felt a numb urge to vomit.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    incomparable horror of Tatsumichi's face wasn't a trivial matter, but
    for Shuya something even more important concerned himself. Yes. He
    had killed someone. Worse yet, a fellow classmate.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was no use convincing himself it was an accident. After all, he had
    done everything he could to deflect the blade, and therefore direct
    it towards Tatsumichi by twisting Tatsumichi's wrists as far back as
    possible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt incredibly nauseous.&nbsp;But Shuya gulped and held back the
    urge to vomit. He lifted his head and looked up at the slope he'd
    just tumbled down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    couldn't see beyond the shrubbery covering the slope. He'd left
    Noriko alone. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
    important thing now was to protect Noriko</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    He had no time to puke. He had to hurry back to Noriko, Shuya told
    himself as if these thoughts would calm him down. He stood up and
    stared down at Tatsumichi's face and the hatchet for a while.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    hesitated but then pursed his lips together and pried Tatsumichi's
    fingers loose from the handle of the hatchet that split his face. He
    couldn't just leave Tatsumichi like this. Of course he couldn't bury
    him—but Tatsumichi's hatchet face was just too much. He couldn't
    bear it. He grabbed the handle and tried to pull the hatchet out of
    Tatsumichi's face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tatsumichi's
    face was stuck to it though as it came up with the hatchet. The
    hatchet was lodged in so deeply, it was stuck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    God</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he thought about it. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>No.
    What's this about God? Ms. Anno was a devoted Christian but no thanks
    to her faith in God she ended up getting raped by Sakamochi. Ah,
    praise the Lord.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt another surge of anger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    clenched his teeth and knelt beside Tatsumichi's head and put his
    trembling left hand on his classmate's forehead. With his right hand
    he pulled on the hatchet, which made a horrible spurting sound&nbsp;as
    blood sprayed out of Tatsumichi's face, and the hatchet came loose.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt as if he were in a nightmare. Cracked in the middle,
    Tatsumichi's head was now asymmetrical. It looked too unreal. It
    looked like a plastic fake. Shuya realized for the first time in his
    life how malleable and fragile the human body was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    gave up trying to close Tatsumichi's eyes. His left eyeball and
    eyelid was split, the eyelid shriveled and swollen so badly it
    couldn't be shut. His right eye was probably manageable, but who'd
    want a winking corpse? It was in bad taste given the circumstances.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt sick again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he stood up again and turned around. To get back to Noriko he'd have
    to take the long way around up the foot trail.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    eyes opened wide again though now because...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	...there
    was a boy wearing glasses and a school coat in the middle of the
    field—the male class representative, Kyoichi Motobuchi.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Behind
    his silver-framed glasses, the class representative's eyes met
    Shuya's. His hair that was always so neatly parted at a 7:3 ratio was
    now a complete mess. The lenses of his glasses looked smudged, and
    the eyes behind them were bloodshot and wide open the way
    Tatsumichi's eyes were. His face was incredibly pale, as it was
    inside the classroom, once again resembling a Warhol print. It didn't
    look human anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    the gun flinched, Shuya twisted his body and ducked backwards. With
    an explosive pop, the gun set off a small flame. Something hot grazed
    the top of his head. Of course he might have just imagined it.
    Anyway, the bullet missed him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    on his back, Shuya didn't have time to think. He just tried to
    retreat. The tall grass made a rustling sound under his back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was too close. He couldn't escape. Kyoichi Motobuchi was only several
    meters away from Shuya, aiming directly at his chest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    face grew as stiff as a plaster sculpture. More than protecting
    Noriko, more than anything, it was real fear that caught him now,
    welling up inside. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
    next tiny lead bullet that gun spits out will kill me! kill...me!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it!&quot; Another voice yelled.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kyoichi
    suddenly turned in a diagonal direction. Shuya also followed
    Kyoichi's glance—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    large figure stood in the shade of the shrine. Buzzed hair, no, the
    head was practically bald, the prominent scars above his brows, the
    tough face of a thug. It was Shogo Kawada (Male Student No. 5). He
    held a pump-action shotgun (a sawed-off Remington M-31).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    any warning Kyoichi shot at Shogo. Shuya saw Shogo quickly duck. As
    he heard the explosion from the shotgun that Shogo held in his
    kneeling position, sparks flew from the muzzle like a flame thrower,
    and the next moment Kyoichi's right arm was gone. Bloody mist shot
    into the air. Kyoichi gazed blankly at the half-sleeve of his school
    uniform. The rest of his sleeve, from his elbow to the hand that was
    holding the gun, was now lying on the grass. Shogo quickly pumped the
    shotgun and loaded the next shot. A red plastic shell flew out to the
    side after spitting out its pellets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;AIEEEE!&quot;&nbsp;Kyoichi
    screamed like an animal as he suddenly realized what had happened.
    Shuya thought he would fall to his knees.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he didn't. The representative instead ran for his arm. He pried the
    gun loose from his right hand with his left hand. Like a one-man
    baton relay. Great. Shuya once again felt like he was watching a bad
    horror flick. Or better yet, reading a bad horror novel.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Damn,
    this was bad.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it!&quot; Shogo shouted, but Kyoichi refused and pointed his gun at
    Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shot again. Kyoichi's body bent over into a triangle shape, with his
    waist pointing out like a long jumper, but blown backwards. He landed
    feet first, and as if in time-lapse photography the next moment he
    was falling on the ground face up. He sank into the overgrown grass
    and remained still.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    scrambled to his feet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    could see Kyoichi's body between the blades of grass. There was a
    gaping hole in the stomach of the school coat, and the contents
    inside looked like a trash bin in a sausage factory.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    hardly paid any attention to the corpse and quickly approached Shuya
    with his shotgun. He pumped the shotgun again and ejected the empty
    shell.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was overwhelmed by the quick succession of events and the horrific
    deaths of Tatsumichi and Kyoichi, but he managed to say between heavy
    breaths, &quot;Hold on, I'm—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stopped behind Kyoichi's body and said, &quot;Don't move. Drop your
    weapon.&quot; Shuya finally realized he was still holding the
    hatchet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    did as he was told. The blood-drenched hatchet fell to the ground
    with a thud.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when Noriko appeared, standing where the trail nose dived.
    Dragging her leg, she had made her way through the thicket, following
    Tatsumichi and Shuya after they tumbled down the slope. (Shuya then
    realized that less than a minute had elapsed since his confrontation
    with Tatsumichi Oki.) She'd turned pale from the gunfire, but now she
    was holding her breath at the sight of the sprawled out corpses of
    Tatsumichi and Kyoichi while Shogo and Shuya faced each other.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    immediately noticed Noriko and pointed his shotgun at her. Noriko's
    body stiffened. &quot;Stop it!&quot; Shuya shouted. &quot;Noriko is
    with me! We don't want to fight at all!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    turned slowly to Shuya. He had a strange, blank look.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shouted at Noriko, &quot;Noriko! Shogo saved me. Shogo isn't an
    enemy!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Noriko and then returned his gaze to Shuya. Then he lowered
    the muzzle.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    remaining frozen for a while, Noriko raised her hand to indicate her
    hands were empty, then nearly slid down the steep trail. She
    staggered, dragging her right leg, and as she drew herself up next to
    Shuya they both looked at Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stared back at them as if they were a pair of Armadillo twins. Shuya
    noticed that the stubble on his cheek and chin had grown a little.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;First,
    let me explain,&quot; Shogo finally said, &quot;I had no choice but
    to shoot Kyoichi. You understand?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Looking
    over at Kyoichi's body, Shuya considered Shogo's words and realized
    that maybe, maybe the representative had totally lost control. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He
    might have seen me beat Tatsumichi Oki and gotten the wrong
    impression. Noriko wasn't around so it would have been natural</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Shogo said, Shuya had no right to fault Shogo for his actions. If
    Shogo didn't kill Kyoichi, then Kyoichi would have killed Shuya.
    After all, he had also killed someone. Tatsumichi Oki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked back at Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    I know. Thanks. You saved me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged. &quot;I was just trying to stop Kyoichi, but I guess I
    ended up doing that as well.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Adrenaline
    was still rushing through his body, but Shuya managed to blurt out,
    &quot;I'm so glad. I'm so relieved we've met someone else who's
    normal.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    fact Shuya was surprised. Back in the classroom he thought if anyone
    was going to play the game it'd be Shogo. But not only was he not
    playing along, he'd managed to save Shuya's life.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stared at them for a while, as if he were thinking through something.
    Then he said, &quot;So you two are together?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    raised his brow. &quot;That's what I said.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Shogo asked, &quot;Why are you two together?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko looked at each other. Then they looked at Shogo. Shuya was
    in the middle of saying, &quot;What do you mean...&quot; but then
    stopped as Noriko asked the same question, but she stopped in
    mid-sentence too, realizing Shuya was asking the same thing. Shuya
    and Noriko looked at each other again. Shuya thought Noriko was
    giving him the green light to speak first, but then as soon as he
    began speaking, his words overlapped with hers, &quot;That's
    because...&quot; Once again Shuya and Noriko exchanged glances. They
    ended up facing Shogo without saying a word.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    quick grin ran across Shogo's face. If he was smiling, it was the
    first time Shuya had ever seen him smile.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    said, &quot;All right, all right. In any case, we have to hide out.
    We don't want to be standing out here in the open.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    played back the scene she had just witnessed in her head. The
    incident she saw from the bushes. Tatsumichi Oki's head split wide

    Shuya and Noriko returned to the thicket where they'd settled last
    night and picked up their bags, Shogo remarked their view was no good
    here. Shuya thought he'd been thorough choosing this location, but
    Shogo seemed abnormally adept in this environment, so they did as he
    said and moved towards the mountain. The dirty cat was gone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    left them in the nearby shrubs. Noriko sat down to rest, and Shuya
    sat next to her. He was holding the revolver (Smith &amp; Wesson .38
    Chief's Special) Shogo had given him after retrieving it from
    Kyoichi's body. It made him feel uncomfortable, and he didn't want to
    carry it— he'd seen that grotesque one-man baton hand off—but he
    managed to hold it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya,
    here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    held out a pink band-aid. She must have found it in the day pack
    Tatsumichi Oki's hatchet had torn through. Shuya touched his right
    ear with his left hand. The bleeding seemed to have stopped, but he
    felt a stinging pain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    still.&quot; Noriko drew near him and opened the band-aid seal.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she carefully wrapped it around his earlobe, she said, &quot;I wonder
    why so many of us came here. Five students, if we include Shogo and
    us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked back at Noriko. The thought didn't even occur to him thanks to
    all those action scenes, but she was right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    shook his head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know. We came here to get as far away as possible, right? We
    avoided climbing the hill and avoided the shore, where there's too
    much visibility. Maybe we were all thinking the same thing and ended
    up at the same place, thinking we'd be safe here, including the
    representative— and Tatsumichi.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    moment he mentioned Tatsumichi, he felt a nauseous pain in his
    stomach again. His face split down the middle, left and right out of
    alignment like a peanut. And this corpse was lying right nearby.
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Ladies
    and gentlemen, the magnificent Peanut Man....</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Along
    with the nausea, Shuya's thoughts which had been numbed by the
    adrenaline rush of fighting finally grew clearer and the sensation of
    numbness finally subsided. He was coming back to his senses.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya.
    You're pale. Are you okay?&quot; Noriko asked, but Shuya couldn't
    respond. A shiver ran through his body, and he began to tremble. His
    body shook as if it were vibrating. His teeth chattered
    uncontrollably as if dancing a crazy tap dance.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    wrong?&quot; Noriko put her hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    answered, his teeth still chattering, &quot;I'm scared.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    twisted his neck to the left and looked at Noriko. She glanced back
    at him with a look of concern.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    scared. I'm scared shitless. I just killed someone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked into Shuya's eyes for a while, then she cautiously moved her
    injured right leg and sat diagonally in front of Shuya with her knees
    bent. Then she gently opened her arms and wrapped them around Shuya's
    shoulders. Her cheek touched his trembling cheeks. He felt her
    warmth, and his nostrils which had been overwhelmed with the smell of
    blood could detect a slight whiff of something like cologne or
    shampoo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was surprised, but he was grateful for the comforting warmth and
    smell and sat still, hugging his knees.&nbsp;It reminded him of the
    time his mother hugged him as a child before she died. As he looked
    at the collar of Noriko's sailor suit, he had a fleeting image of his
    mother. She spoke clearly, always so full of energy. Even as a child
    he thought she was a stylish mother. Her face, oh man, looked a lot
    like Kazumi Shintani's. She was always exchanging smiles with his
    father who, with his mustache, didn't seem like your typical
    salaryman. (Wrapped in her arms, he would hear her say, &quot;Your
    father works in law and helps people in trouble. It's a very
    important job in this country.&quot;)&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Some
    day I'm going to marry someone like my mom and then I'll be smiling
    all the time the way Mom and Dad are</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Their smiles made him feel that way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    trembling gradually subsided and disappeared.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you all right?&quot; Noriko asked.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    think so. Thanks.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    slowly let him go.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    a while, Shuya said, &quot;You smell nice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    smiled bashfully. &quot;Oh God, I didn't take a bath yesterday.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    you really do smell nice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    smile flashed across Noriko's face again, when the bushes rustled.
    Shuya shielded her with his left arm and held the Smith &amp; Wesson.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    shoot. It's me.&quot; Parting the thick bushes, Shogo entered. Shuya
    lowered the gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    carried two day packs along with the shotgun slung over his shoulder
    on a sling. He took out a small cardboard box and tossed it over to
    Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    caught it in mid-air and opened it. The golden bottoms of bullets in
    neat rows. Five bullets were</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	missing
    like cavities.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Bullets
    for your gun. Load it,&quot; Shogo said, then put his shotgun by his
    side and pulled at some worn out fishing wire. He pulled at one end
    tightly and Shuya saw how the wire went straight into the deep end of
    the bushes. Shogo then took out a small knife from his pocket and
    snapped the blade out of its handle. Shogo's supplied weapon was a
    shotgun, so, Shuya figured, the knife he must have brought on his
    own.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    made a notch with the knife into a nearby tree trunk no thicker than
    a can of Coke. Then he fit the taught wire snugly into the notch and
    cut off the excess. He tied the remaining wire around the tree trunk
    in the same manner.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    are you doing?&quot; Shuya asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This?&quot;
    Shogo put away his knife and answered, &quot;You might call it a
    primitive alarm system. We're at the center. The wire runs around us
    in a circle with a twenty meter radius. The wire's doubled. The
    moment it catches someone, this will be pulled and fall from the
    tree. Don't worry, the intruder won't even notice. It'll provide us
    with a warning.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Where
    did you find that wire?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    tilted his head slightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There
    was a little general supply store. I wanted to get my hands on some
    things, so that was my first destination. That's where I found it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked astonished. Of course. No matter how small this island was
    there had to be at least one supply store. But the thought never even
    crossed his mind. Of course it wouldn't have been possible for him to
    wander around given how he had to look after Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    sat down where he could face both Shuya and Noriko. He began sorting
    through a day pack that belonged either to Tatsumichi or Kyoichi.
    Taking out a bottle of water and some bread rolls, he said, &quot;How
    about some breakfast?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    hugging his knees, Shuya shook his head. He had no appetite
    whatsoever.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    wrong? You feel nauseous from killing Tatsumichi?&quot;&nbsp;Shogo
    examined Shuya's face and said casually, &quot;Don't let it get to
    you. Let's say each person kills one person. The game's like a
    tournament. It's forty-two, no, forty students, so if you kill five
    or six, then you'll be the winner. Four or five more, that's all
    you'll need.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knew he was joking, but no, it was all the more offensive because he
    was joking. He glared at Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sensing
    Shuya's anger, Shogo drew back. &quot;Sorry man, I was just kidding.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    asked in a hostile tone, &quot;So you don't feel nauseous? Or did you
    already kill someone before Kyoichi?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    merely shrugged. &quot;Well, this time, it was my first.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a strange way to put it, Shuya thought, but he had no idea what
    was so odd about it. He felt confused. If Shogo was the rumored
    delinquent he was said to be then he might be bold in a way Shuya
    could never be.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head and changed the subject. &quot;You know, there's
    something I don't get.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    raised his brow. The ugly scar above his left brow moved with it.
    &quot;What's that?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    representative... Kyoichi...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey.&quot;
    Shogo pointed his chin up at him to cut him off. &quot;I thought you
    understood. I didn't have any choice. Are you saying I should have
    let him kill me? I'm not Jesus Christ, okay? Besides, I can't be
    resurrected, although I've never tried it out....&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    that's not what I meant.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Shuya continued, he wondered whether Shogo was kidding again. Was
    Shogo Kawada the joking type?&nbsp;&quot;I think the reason Kyoichi
    tried to shoot me was that he saw me kill...Tatsumichi up close. I
    killed Tatsumichi. And that was because he attacked me—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    gave a light nod.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    it was only natural that Kyoichi would try to kill me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    true. Maybe. But even so I—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,&quot;
    Shuya interrupted Shogo. &quot;Forget about that. What I mean is that
    Tatsumichi...Tatsumichi came after me even though I didn't do a
    thing. And besides, I was with Noriko. Why did he have to attack us?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged and put his water bottle and bread by his feet.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Tatsumichi
    was up for it. That's all. What's to understand?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    well...theoretically, yes, but...I just don't get it. How Tatsumichi
    could—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    cut off Shuya's hesitant words, &quot;There's no need to understand.&quot;
    &quot;Huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    lips twisted slightly as if grinning, then he went on, &quot;I'm only
    a transfer student, so I don't know much about you and your
    classmates. But what do you know about Tatsumichi? Maybe there's
    someone really ill in his family, so he felt he had to survive. Or
    maybe he was just being selfish. Or maybe he went insane from fear
    and lost his capacity for reason. Or there's even this possibility:
    you were with her. He might have thought you teamed up with her. How
    can he tell whether he's invited? You and her might have decided he's
    a threat. Or if you were actually playing the game, then you could
    use this same excuse to kill him. Hey, did you provoke him at all?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No...&quot;
    Shuya stopped, recalling how he'd reflexively touched his knife when
    he faced Tatsumichi. Shuya himself had also been afraid. He'd been
    afraid of Tatsumichi.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Was
    there something?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    touched my knife.&quot; He looked at Shogo. &quot;But that's not
    enough to—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head. &quot;Oh yeah it is, Shuya. Tatsumichi might have
    thought, I have to beat you, since you're holding a weapon.
    Everyone's fuse in this game is pretty short.&quot;&nbsp;He said, as
    if to conclude the topic, &quot;But in the end Tatsumichi was up for
    it. That's the best way to understand it. Look, there's no need to
    understand. What it comes down to is this. Once your opponent attacks
    you with a weapon, you don't hesitate. Otherwise you'll die. You
    can't afford to think about it. The first thing you do is anticipate
    your opponent. You shouldn't trust people too much in this game.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath. Did Tatsumichi really want to kill me? Then
    again, as Shogo said, it might be pointless to think too much about
    it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked up at Shogo again. &quot;That's right.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    what is it? Come on.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    continued, &quot;Why are you here with us?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    raised his eyebrows. He licked his lips.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Good
    point. I might be against you too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    not what I mean.&quot; Shuya shook his head. &quot;You saved me. No,
    you also risked your life trying to stop Kyoichi. I'm not suspecting
    you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    you got it wrong, Shuya. You don't seem to understand this game yet.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;...what
    do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    continued, &quot;In order to survive, being in a group gives you an
    advantage this game.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    considered this, then nodded. He was right. You could take turns
    being on the lookout, and you were stronger in case of an
    attack.&nbsp;&quot;So?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Think
    about it.&quot; Shogo nudged the shotgun resting on his knees with
    his hand. &quot;Do you think I was risking much to stop Kyoichi? Do
    you think ordering him to stop would have actually stopped him? Maybe
    I was already planning on killing Kyoichi. Did I really have to kill
    him? Kyoichi never struck me as the type who'd attract a group, but
    maybe I ordered him to stop just to put on an act for you guys to
    join me. Wouldn't it be in my best interests to join you guys and
    then kill you off later?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stared at Shogo's face, surprised by this series of clear and logical
    explanations. It was true Shogo was a year older than them. But he
    talked like an adult—a wise, mature adult. In this sense he
    resembled Shinji Mimura.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There'll
    be no end to it if I start getting suspicious. You're not against

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Me
    too.&quot; Noriko nodded. &quot;If we can't trust anyone we'll lose.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    a noble thought, girl,&quot; Shogo nodded. &quot;If that's the way
    you want it. I'm just telling you that you got to be careful in this
    game.&quot; Then he asked, &quot;So what is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    all of a sudden remembered he was the one with the questions. &quot;You.
    Why do you trust us? Teaming up with you doesn't necessarily rule out
    that one or both of us is against you. You said so yourself. You have
    no reason to trust us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see,&quot; Shogo responded, as if amused. &quot;An applied question.
    You're getting the hang of it, Shuya.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on, I want an answer.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    waved his hand still holding the revolver. Shogo drew back as if to
    warn him it was dangerous.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well?&quot;
    Shuya insisted. Shogo raised his brow again. Then he revealed that
    faint smile on his face. He looked up at the branches looming above
    them and then looked back at Shuya and Noriko. He looked serious.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;First
    of all—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    saw something intense run across Shogo's calm eyes. He didn't know
    what it meant but it was intense.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    have my reasons. I have a problem with the rules. No, the game
    itself.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stopped for a moment and then continued, &quot;You're absolutely
    right, but...you see, I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I've always
    based my decisions on my conscience. So—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grabbed the barrel of his shotgun standing between his knees as if it
    were a cane and looked at them. A bird was chirping deep in the
    woods. Shogo looked solemn. Shuya listened nervously.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    two make a nice couple. That's what I thought when I saw you this
    morning, and I still think so now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    spoke first. Her cheeks were bright red. &quot;You have it all wrong.
    We're not. I'm not—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Shuya and Noriko and grinned. Then he broke out laughing.
    It was an unexpected, friendly laugh. He continued chuckling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    why I trust you. Besides, you just said so yourselves. There's no end

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    finally grinned. Then he said sincerely, &quot;Thanks. I'm so glad

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Easy
    with the fancy terminology. Sorry but I was born with these looks. I
    can't help it if I don't look friendly.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    gave him a warm smile and said, &quot;I'm so glad. Now we have one

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Responding
    to Noriko, Shogo rubbed his finger against the stubble under his nose
    and made an unexpected gesture. He turned to Shuya and offered his
    right hand. &quot;I'm glad too...now that I'm not alone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    squeezed his hand. Shogo's palms were thick. In keeping with his

    was sitting against a wall, she squinted her eyes. She was
    remembering the trite phrase repeated in the sermons given by the
    local priest of the Halo Church which her parents and she (before her

    lightly shook her short, boyish hair with a sarcastic smile. She
    looked over at Yukiko Kitano (Female Student No. 6), who was sitting
    near her, also against the wall. Yukiko remained in a daze, staring
    at the wooden floor bathed in light. Even though it had the bombastic
    name &quot;Okishima Island Tourist Association&quot; the building
    resembled a plain town council hall. Down by the lower entrance,
    there was an office desk, a chair, and a rusty file cabinet. The desk
    had a phone (she'd tried using it, but of course, as Sakamochi had
    warned, there was no dial tone). Inside the file cabinet they only
    found some unattractive tourist flyers.</font></font></p>

    and Yukiko had been friends ever since nursery school. At nursery
    school they were in separate classes and lived in different
    neighborhoods too. They met thanks, once again, to the Halo Church
    where their parents took them. When they met it was Yumiko's third
    visit, but for Yukiko it seemed like it was her first, and she looked
    intimidated by everything there including the gong ringing with every
    chant and the general atmosphere of the heavily decorated church. So
    Yumiko approached the quiet girl left alone by her who were
    preoccupied with some other task and said, &quot;Don't you think this
    is all so stupid?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The

    their names sounded similar, they were very different from each
    other. Yumiko was energetic and got labeled a tomboy. Even now
    (although the chances of that &quot;now&quot; returning were very,
    very low) she batted fourth on the softball team. Yukiko was domestic
    and baked cakes for Yumiko. Yumiko was now fifteen centimeters taller
    than Yukiko. Yukiko often said she envied Yumiko's height and her
    well defined face, but Yumiko was in fact more envious of Yukiko for
    her petite body and round cheeks. It was true; they were totally
    different, but they were still best friends. That didn't change.</font></font></p>

    (well, that's putting it harshly), the death of Yoshitoki Kuninobu

    their own departures to be only two minutes apart from each other.
    After Yumiko left the classroom, she hid behind a pole and waited for
    Yukiko, whose face had turned white. They left together (twenty
    minutes later Yoshio Akamatsu returned to begin killing, but they
    were unaware of this) and headed north far beyond the residential
    area, following the road on the eastern shore. A little ways up the
    northern mountain they found a single building standing alone on a

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Over
    four hours had passed since then. They were exhausted from the
    extreme tension and remained sitting next to each other as time flew
    by.</font></font></p>

    looked away from Yukiko and along with her stared at the floor.</font></font></p>

    though she was in a daze, she continued to think. What in the world
    were they supposed to do now?&nbsp;Sakamochi's announcement was
    audible even inside this building. Aside from Yoshitoki Kuninobu and
    Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, nine classmates were already dead. Aside from
    Sakura Ogawa and Kazuhiko Yamamoto...the others couldn't have been
    suicides. Someone was killing someone else. Right now someone might
    have been dying. In fact she thought she'd heard gunfire right after
    the 6 a.m. announcement.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	How
    could you kill your classmates? Of course those were the rules, but
    she couldn't believe there could be people who'd actually follow
    them. But...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    if someone tried to kill her—if she could assume that much, then
    she would probably fight back. Yes.</font></font></p>

    looked at the megaphone lying in the corner of the room. Could she
    use that? If she could...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wasn't
    there something she could do? She was simply afraid of doing it,
    though. Not just of doing it. Because while she couldn't believe
    anyone was playing the game, she also couldn't rid herself of this
    overwhelming fear. That's what made her seek shelter here with
    Yukiko. What if...what if someone really did...</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    recalled something from when she was in elementary school—the face
    of her best friend. It wasn't Yukiko. The friend was crying. For some
    reason, the only clothes she could remember on her friend was her
    pink sneakers.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yumi,&quot;
    Yukiko said and interrupted Yumiko's thoughts. She faced
    Yukiko.&nbsp;&quot;Let's eat our bread rolls. We won't come up with
    any good ideas if we don't eat.&quot; Yukiko provided a kind smile.
    It felt slightly forced, but it was still her usual smile.&nbsp;&quot;Okay?&quot;
    Yukiko repeated and Yumiko returned her smile and nodded.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    took out their bread rolls and water from their day packs. Yumiko
    looked at the two cans inside. The cans were a greenish silver, and
    at the top a cigar-sized stick stuck out, attached to a lever and a
    metal ring approximately three centimeters in diameter. She assumed
    it was a &quot;hand grenade.&quot; (Yukiko's&nbsp;&quot;weapon&quot;
    was a set of darts. It must have been some kind of joke. It even came
    with a wooden target board.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    she finished half of her roll and took a sip of her water, Yumiko
    said, &quot;You feel a little better now, Yukiko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Yukiko chewed on her bread, her round eyes grew wider.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You've
    been shaking all this time.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,&quot;
    Yukiko broke into a smile. &quot;I think I'm fine now. I mean with
    you by my side.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    smiled and nodded. She wondered whether she should bring up &quot;what
    they should do&quot; while they ate...but decided against it. She
    just wasn't feeling confident enough about her idea. It could be
    extremely dangerous. To go through with it wouldn't only endanger
    herself but Yukiko as well. But on the other hand, it was this kind
    of danger that was forcing everyone to panic over the deadline. What
    was the right thing to do? Yumiko just wasn't sure yet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    remained quiet for a while. Then Yukiko all of a sudden said, &quot;Hey,
    Yumiko.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hm?

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You

    small but full lips.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    hesitated but then finally let it out, &quot;Did you have a crush on
    anyone in our class?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko's
    eyes suddenly grew wide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wow.
    This was exactly the kind of topic you discussed at night when you're
    on a study trip. After going through the rituals of playing cards,
    pillow fighting, and checking out the inn, late at night you could
    bitch about your teachers, or talk about the future, but none of
    those were in the same league as this topic. It was the holy topic.
    And of course she'd expected to have this kind of conversation during
    their study trip, until they'd fallen asleep on the bus.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    mean, a guy?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko's
    downcast eyes bashfully looked over at Yumiko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hmm.&quot;
    Yumiko hesitated a little but then replied honestly, &quot;Yes, I
    did.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see.&quot; Yukiko looked down at the knees of her pleated skirt and
    said, &quot;I'm sorry I never told you, but I like...Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    nodded without saying a word. She already had a hunch.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    her mind Yumiko pulled out her file on Shuya Nanahara. He was 171
    centimeters tall, weighed 58 kilograms, his eyesight was 1.2 in the
    right eye, 1.5 in the left, and although he was thin he was muscular.
    In elementary school he was a Little League shortstop and batted
    first, but he quit and now preferred playing music. He was an
    excellent singer and guitarist. Because of his status as the team's
    best player during his Little League days, combined with the fact
    that the first kanji character to his last name meant &quot;seven,&quot;
    he had the baseball nickname of &quot;Wild Seven,&quot; just like the
    cigarette brand. His blood type was&nbsp;B, and he was born, just as
    the first character of his first name indicated, in the fall. He lost
    his parents when he was young, and now he lived in a Catholic
    orphanage called the Charity House. He was best friends with
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu—</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>oh
    God and now he was dead</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">—who
    also lived in the Charity House. His strongest subjects were in the
    humanities, literature, and English, so he was a decent student. He
    had a unique face, his lips were slightly curved, but his double
    eyelids were sharply defined and kind looking, so he wasn't bad
    looking at all. His hair was slightly wavy and long, covering his
    neck and touching his shoulders.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko's
    file on Shuya Nanahara was filled to bursting (she was pretty
    confident hers was more thorough than Yukiko's). One of the more
    important subjects in the file was his height. Because, she thought,
    if Shuya didn't grow any taller then she wouldn't be able to wear
    high heels with him, because that would make her taller than him if
    they walked together.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    now that she was sure about Yukiko, she wouldn't be able to share
    these thoughts with her.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh.&quot;
    Yumiko tried to look as calm as possible. &quot;Really?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hm.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    looked down. Then she made the point she'd wanted to make all along,
    &quot;I really want to see him. I wonder what he's doing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she sat with her hands glued to her thighs, she burst into tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    gently touched Yukiko on the shoulder. &quot;Don't worry. Knowing
    Shuya, no matter what happens—&quot; Realizing though that this
    might have sounded funny, she immediately added, nervously, &quot;You
    know how athletic he is, plus he seems really gutsy. I mean I don't
    really know but...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    wiped away her tears and nodded, &quot;Uh huh.&quot; Then as if she
    felt better, she asked, &quot;So who do you like, Yumiko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    could only look up at the ceiling and force a moan, &quot;Hmm,&quot;
    as she thought it through. She was in trouble. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Maybe
    I'll just randomly pick someone just to avoid the issue.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tatsumichi
    Oki was a star player on the handball team. Even though his face was
    kind of coarse he seemed like a nice guy. Everyone called Shinji
    Mimura a genius basketball player, and he knew so much. He even had a
    &quot;following&quot; of girls who were into him. (They weren't from
    their class, maybe because his general reputation among the Class B
    girls was that he was a playboy.) Mitsuru Numai acted like he was a
    badass, but he didn't really seem so bad. He was kind to girls—</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>oh
    God but he's dead too now</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Hiroki Sugimura seemed to have a brooding quality that was kind of
    cool. Some girls were afraid of him because he practiced martial
    arts, but to Yumiko that was attractive. But he was close to Takako
    Chigusa. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Takako

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    faced Yukiko again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    hesitated again—but then she decided to let it out. At the very

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    folded her arms to concentrate. Then she asked, &quot;Do you really
    think there are people who want to kill others...in our class?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    knit her brows slightly.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well...I
    mean the fact is that...they di—&quot; As she pronounced the word
    &quot;died&quot; her voice trembled, &quot;...died. All of them. It
    was announced this morning. Nine students have already been killed
    since our departure. They couldn't have all been suicides...Besides,
    didn't we just hear gunfire a little while ago?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    tilted her head as she looked at Yukiko. She spread out her hands.
    She noticed for the first time that her left cuff was slightly torn.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Now
    look. You see how terrified we are here. The two of us, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    seemed to mull over her point. Then she said, &quot;Yes, maybe. I've
    been so preoccupied with my own fear, that thought didn't even occur
    to me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    nodded once and continued, &quot;And because we were lucky enough to
    end up together it's probably nowhere near as bad as being alone,
    which I'm sure would be absolutely terrifying.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    you're right.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'd
    run away.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    if you couldn't?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    seemed to consider the situation carefully. Then she spoke slowly,
    &quot;I-I-I just might fight. If I had something I might throw it, or
    if I had something like a gun I might, I just might shoot it—of
    course, I'd try to talk. But if it happened quickly and I didn't have
    any choice...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    nodded.&nbsp;&quot;Exactly. That's why I think no one here really
    wants to kill anyone. I think it's because we're so terrified we
    become deluded that everyone else is out to kill us and so we resort
    to fighting. And in that state even if no one attacked, we might even
    end up attacking others on our own.&quot; She interrupted herself,
    unfolded her arms, put her hands on the floor, and continued, &quot;I
    think everyone's just terrified.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    pursed her small, full lips together. After a while, she looked down
    at the floor and said in a halting voice, &quot;I don't know. I just
    can't trust some of them, like Mitsuko Souma's gang, and Kazuo
    Kiriyama's—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko

    glanced up at the ceiling. She recalled the face of her friend

    huh.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    it disappeared.&quot; Yumiko looked down. &quot;I suspected my friend
    of stealing it. She wanted it so badly. On top of that, I realized it
    was gone after first period gym class and she'd excused herself from
    gym because she wasn't feeling well and returned to our classroom.
    And, this is really awful, she didn't have a father and her mother
    worked at a bar, so she didn't have a good reputation.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    bombarded her with questions, but she said she didn't know. And I
    even told the teacher about it. Our teacher, come to think of it, the

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    remained silent and continued listening.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    apologized to her. She said it was all right. But it just turned out
    all awkward and she ended up—I think her mother ended up
    remarrying—transferring schools and that was it. We were such good
    friends, as close as you and me. But in the end I wasn't able to
    trust her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    shrugged and then continued.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    ever since that incident I've been doing my best to trust people. I
    want to trust people. If I can't then everything falls apart. This is
    different from what the folks at that stupid Halo Church preach. This
    is my belief. I hope you understand.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    do.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    let's consider this situation now. Well yeah, Mitsuko Souma does seem
    dangerous. That's her reputation. But I doubt she's so bad she'd
    actually get off on killing people. She can't be that bad. No one in
    our class could be that bad. Don't you think?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Several
    moments later Yukiko nodded and replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So,&quot;
    Yumiko continued, &quot;if we could just contact everyone
    appropriately then the fighting would stop. Then we could figure out
    together how to deal with the circumstances. No, even if we couldn't
    do anything, at the very least we could avoid killing each other.
    Don't you think?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes...&quot;&nbsp;Yukiko
    nodded, but she sounded hesitant. A little worn out from talking,
    Yumiko took a deep breath and shifted her legs again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;In
    any case, that's my opinion. Now let me hear yours. If you're against
    it, then I won't do it.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    looked down at the floor in contemplation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    two full minutes she mumbled, &quot;Remember how you once told me
    that I'm always too worried about other people's opinions?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hm?
    Did I say that?&quot; Yumiko examined Yukiko's face. Yukiko looked up
    and their eyes met. Yukiko smiled gently. &quot;I think you're
    absolutely right. That's my opinion.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    smiled back at her and said, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She felt grateful
    towards Yukiko for seriously considering the idea on her own before
    sharing her thoughts. And now it seemed that her response confirmed
    the validity of her idea.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>We
    have to do this. I don't want to die without putting up a fight. If
    there's a chance then let's go for it. Just as I said to Yukiko, I
    want to trust people. Let's try it.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Yukiko asked, &quot;But how are we going to do this? How can we
    contact everyone?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    pointed at the megaphone lying in the corner of the room. &quot;We
    have to figure out how to use that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    gave several small nods and looked up at the ceiling. Then she
    uttered, &quot;If all goes well, I'll be able to see Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    nodded. &quot;Yes, I'm sure we will,&quot; she said hopefully this
    time.</font></font></p>

    tossed the needle and thread onto the day pack beside him and said to
    Shuya, &quot;I need the whiskey again.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko's
    bent right leg rested on its side. The wound on her calf was sewn up
    with coarse cotton thread.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    had managed to stitch it up. Of course they had no anesthetic, but
    Noriko managed not to cry during the ten-minute operation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    offered the flask to Shogo. Next to them was a small rock pit. The
    empty can rested on top of the charcoal, and the water inside was
    boiling. (Shogo had explained how he'd found the charcoal along with
    the needle and thread at the supply store.) He disinfected the needle
    and thread with the boiling water, but applying it directly to her
    wound was out of the question. Shogo had already soaked her wound
    with whiskey before he began stitching. He was going to disinfect
    again. Noriko, who'd managed to relax a little, now grimaced again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at his watch. Because of the time it took to boil the water,
    it was already past 8 a.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay,&quot;
    Shogo said as he pressed the disinfected bandanna on her wound. Then
    he quickly wrapped another bandanna around Noriko's leg. &quot;We're
    done.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    added with a note of concern, &quot;I hope the wound hasn't been
    infected.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    tucked in her leg and showed her gratitude to Shogo, &quot;Thank you.
    That was impressive.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    I'm good at playing doctor,&quot; Shogo said as he took out a Wild
    Seven cigarette from his pocket, put it between his lips, and lit it
    with a disposable lighter. Did he get those from the store, or did he
    bring them along for the trip? Like Buster and hi-night, they were a
    popular brand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    gazed at the package, illustrated with silhouettes of motorcycle
    riders. He had no idea what they were referring to. The cigarettes
    piqued his curiosity, because Shuya's baseball nickname was the same
    as this cigarette brand. The name came naturally. Shuya was the star
    player of his Little League team. He was a great clutch hitter with
    men in scoring position, and once he was on base, and no one else
    could get any hits, he could create his own scoring opportunities by
    stealing a base (he held the impressive record of stealing home three
    times in one season). When the bases were loaded, and their pitcher
    was in a pinch, he'd make the play to get them out of the jam, and if
    the pitcher was too tired, he'd switch from shortstop to pitcher.
    &quot;Wild Card Nana (Seven),&quot; yessir.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    his second year of junior high he became classmates with the star
    shooting guard of the basketball team, Shinji Mimura. Shinji's
    nickname was &quot;The Third Man,&quot; which he got during his first
    year when he sat on the bench as the second backup guard. But with
    five minutes left and their team trailing by twenty in the district
    finals, this third man came onto the court and single-handedly
    brought his team to victory. Ever since then Shinji was a fixture in
    the starting lineup, and Shiroiwa Junior High turned into one of the
    prefecture's top-ranked basketball teams. But because of that game,
    and because of the kanji character of &quot;three&quot; in his last
    name, the &quot;Third Man&quot; name stuck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    this year's class games, the girls as a joke made a pair of uniforms
    stitched with the numbers 7 and 3. Shuya and Shinji wore these
    uniforms during the games. It felt like a remote world. Shuya
    wondered again where Shinji was. Shinji would have been a big help.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if the thought suddenly occurred to him, Shogo searched his pockets
    and pulled out a small leather pouch.&nbsp;He took out a sheet of
    white pills wrapped in aluminum foil and plastic and gave it to
    Noriko.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Pain
    relievers. You should take some.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    blinked. But then she took the pills.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    said to Shogo, &quot;Hey...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;
    Shogo slowly blew smoke out his mouth and looked at Shuya. &quot;Don't
    stare at me. It's not that uncommon to see a junior high kid smoking.
    Anyway I'm old enough to be in high school. And you're the one who
    brought your own supply of whiskey.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    high school students are allowed to smoke? Well, that wasn't his
    point anyway. Shuya shook his head, &quot;That's not what I meant.
    Did you find those pills at the store too?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged. &quot;Well yeah. It wasn't exactly merchandise. I took it
    out of the first aid kit behind the cash register. It's not a big
    deal. Just some aspirin called Gomez. What an obnoxious name for
    aspirin, huh? Anyway it'll stop the pain.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pursed his lips. Well, he might be telling the truth, but... &quot;I
    don't get how you can be so well prepared. And where'd you learn to
    stitch up a wound?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    mouth broke into a wide grin. He shrugged and replied, &quot;My dad
    was a doctor.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;He
    ran a small dump, a clinic in the slums of Kobe. I've seen him sew
    people up ever since I was a kid. In fact I was a pretty good nurse.
    I even did some work myself. My dad couldn't even afford to hire a
    nurse.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was speechless. Was he telling the truth?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    held up the cigarette between his fingers, as if to cut off Shuya's
    response. &quot;It's true. Just think about it and you'll see how
    important medicine is in these circumstances.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    kept quiet for a moment, but then recalled something else that
    puzzled him.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh
    yeah...&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    mind if I ask—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Skip
    the formalities, Shuya. We're in this together.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shrugged once and then rephrased what he had to say. &quot;Back on
    the bus, you were trying to open the window. You must have realized
    there was sleeping gas.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hearing
    this, Noriko gave Shogo a puzzled look.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    time Shogo shrugged.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you saw me? You should have lent me a hand.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    couldn't. How did you know what was going on, though? I mean there
    was no smell or anything—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh
    yeah there was,&quot; Shogo replied and rubbed his half finished
    cigarette into the ground. &quot;It was faint, but if you've smelled
    it once you'd recognize it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    did you recognize it?&quot; This time Noriko asked. &quot;My uncle
    actually worked at a state chemical lab and—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on,&quot; Shuya interrupted him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grimaced and said, &quot;If I have to, I'll explain it later. As far
    as I'm concerned I blew it big time. I Should've noticed sooner. And
    I certainly didn't expect this to happen...but we should be focused
    on the present. Do you have any plans?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>If
    I have to, I'll explain later?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    That statement bothered Shuya, but Shogo was right. Their priority
    was to come up with a plan for their escape. He put his questions on
    hold and said, &quot;We're planning on escaping.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    lit another cigarette and nodded. Then as if suddenly remembering
    what he had to do, he tossed dirt onto the charcoal inside the rock
    pit. Shuya heard the sound of Noriko swallowing a pill with water.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    continued. &quot;How hard do you think it'll be?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head. &quot;The question is whether it's possible at all.
    My answer would be 'extremely remote.' So what then?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well
    even if we escaped...&quot; Shuya lifted his hand up to his neck, to
    the object that was wrapped around Shogo's and Noriko's necks as
    well, &quot;...we'd be immediately discovered because of these
    collars.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yep.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And
    we can't get near that school.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    had said that &quot;twenty minutes after your departure this school
    will become a forbidden zone.&quot; </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Bastard.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;True.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    maybe there's a way to lure him out here? Then we take Sakamochi
    hostage. That's how we get them to disable the collars.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    raised his brow. &quot;And?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    licked his lips and continued, &quot;Before doing that we locate a
    ship and escape by taking Sakamochi with us.&quot; Even as he was
    saying it, Shuya knew his plan was hopeless. He hadn't even figured
    out how they were going to lure Sakamochi out from the school. No,
    you couldn't even call it a plan, just an &quot;idea.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    it?&quot; Shogo asked. Shuya could only nod.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    once again puffed on his cigarette. Then he said, &quot;First of all,
    there aren't any ships.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    bit his lip. &quot;You never know.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    briefly smiled and blew out more smoke. &quot;I told you how I went
    to that supply store by the harbor. There weren't any boats. Not one.
    Not even damaged ones left on the shore. Every single boat's been
    taken away. I mean, they were absurdly thorough.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then
    the guard ship will do. As long as we can hold Sakamochi hostage.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    impossible, Shuya,&quot; Shogo interrupted him. &quot;You saw how
    many Special Defense Forces soldiers they had. Besides—&quot; Shogo
    pointed to the silver collar around his neck. &quot;They should be
    able to send the command to ignite these at any time regardless of
    what zone we're in. Anytime, anywhere. The odds are stacked against
    us. Even if we managed to capture Sakamochi, I'm sure as far as the
    government's concerned, he's expendable.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    fell silent again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Do
    you have any other ideas?&quot; Shogo asked him.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head. &quot;No. What about you, Noriko?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    also shook her head. But she had something else to say.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    why I suggested we gather as many people as we can, even if they're
    only the ones we trust, to come up with a plan together. I thought if
    we met together as a group we might come up with a good idea....&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
    right</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Shuya thought. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
    what I forgot to say</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    only raised his scarred left brow. &quot;And who are the ones you
    trust?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    replied enthusiastically, &quot;There's Shinji Mimura. Then there's
    Hiroki Sugimura. Let's see, as far as the girls go, there's our class
    representative, Yukie Utsumi. Shinji is really amazing. He knows a
    lot. He knows so many different things. He's good with machines too.
    He'd come up with something.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    rubbed his stubbly chin with his left hand as he stared at Shuya.
    Then he said, &quot;Shinji, huh...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked surprised. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well...&quot;
    Shogo seemed hesitant but continued, &quot;I saw Shinji....&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What!?
    Where!?&quot; Shuya raised his voice. He exchanged looks with Noriko.
    &quot;Where? Where did you see him?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    pointed his chin to the east. &quot;It was at night. West of the
    school. He seemed to be searching for something inside a house. He
    had a gun, and I think he noticed me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why
    didn't you call out to him?&quot; Shuya raised his voice scornfully.
    Shogo gave Shuya a puzzled look.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    come on, he helped Noriko get back to her seat in the classroom. You
    saw that? Besides—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    predicted the rest, &quot;He tried to have the game postponed for
    Noriko's injury, right? So that there'd be a chance for everyone to
    escape?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head. &quot;You expect me to trust him on account of those
    acts? No way. Besides, he might have been trying to con everyone into
    believing he was a trustworthy guy. It'd suit him fine if he planned
    on getting rid of everyone later.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    ridiculous!&quot; Shuya raised his voice. &quot;How cynical can you
    get? He's not that kind of guy. He's—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    silently extended both of his palms forward and Shuya fell silent. He
    was right. Raising your voice was not a good idea. In fact it was a
    very bad idea.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Shogo said, &quot;Cut me some slack. I don't know Shinji. Like I said
    before, the rule is to suspect, not trust, everyone in this game. And
    you have to be all the more suspicious of someone who's smart.
    Besides, even if I invited him to join me, he probably would've
    refused.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was about to say something, but then exhaled and decided against it.
    Shogo had a point. In fact, it&nbsp;was odd how Shogo could trust him
    and Noriko at all. Shogo did say though that it was because they made
    &quot;a nice couple.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well
    then...&quot; Shuya continued, &quot;we should at least go where you
    saw Shinji. We can definitely trust him. I guarantee it. He'd come up
    with a good idea. He's—&quot; But once again he was interrupted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head and said, &quot;If Shinji is so smart then do you
    think he'd stay where I saw him?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    sighed. It was a very long, deep sigh.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey...&quot;
    Noriko spoke up, &quot;Shogo, I was wondering if there was any way we
    can contact others like Shinji.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook loose another cigarette and shook his head. &quot;I doubt it.
    If we were trying to reach a general, unspecified number of people,
    well maybe, but contacting a particular party or person would be
    difficult.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    fell silent for a while. Shuya stared at Shogo, who had his cigarette
    stuck between his lips. The tip of the Wild Seven crackled and grew
    shorter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then...&quot;
    Shuya said, nearly speechless, &quot;there's nothing we can do.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    responded flatly, &quot;Oh but there is.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    have a plan.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stared again at Shogo's face wrapped in a cloud of smoke. Then he
    suddenly became excited and asked, &quot;What do you mean? Is there a
    way out?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked over at Shuya and Noriko. Then he looked up at the sky in
    contemplation, his cigarette still dangling from his lips. His right
    hand touched the smooth surface of the collar around his neck, as if
    it annoyed him. The smoke slowly drifted by.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    said, &quot;There might be a way.&quot; Then he continued, &quot;On
    one condition, though.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head slightly and then brought his cigarette closer to his
    lips. &quot;We have to be the only survivors.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knit his brows. He didn't understand. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It
    should be obvious.&quot; Shogo looked back at them. &quot;Meaning the
    three of us have to be the only ones alive. The others would have to
    be dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But—&quot;
    Noriko immediately raised her voice. &quot;That's too much! So we're
    just looking after ourselves?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    held his cigarette held between his fingers over his crossed legs and
    raised his brow, &quot;Shuya's escape plan would amount to the same
    thing, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,&quot;
    Shuya intervened. &quot;That's not what Noriko's saying. She's asking
    you whether our survival comes&nbsp;at the cost of everyone else.
    Right, Noriko? That would just be...horrible.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on guy.&quot; Shogo waved his hand. He crushed his cigarette against
    the ground. &quot;I'm not against our group expanding, as long as we
    can trust them. But whether we find others or not, everyone besides
    the ones in our group will have to die.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;If
    that's the case,&quot; Shuya said enthusiastically, &quot;We could
    inform everyone. If you have the most reliable plan then no one will
    oppose it. Then everyone would be saved? Right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    pursed his lips in response to Shuya. Then he asked in a slightly
    irritated tone, &quot;What if we're attacked before we even manage to
    get a word in?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Unless
    you're actively out to kill people, then, relatively speaking that
    is, the smartest way to survive would be to stay put and hide. That's
    the reason why,&quot; Shogo pointed to his collar, &quot;the
    government is using this to force us to move. That's one of the basic
    tenets of this game. Don't forget that. You move around aimlessly,
    and you're a walking target for someone lurking in the shadows. With
    Noriko injured like this, we're prime targets.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Besides,
    when you insist everyone has to be saved, that only means we might
    not get killed here. But what if we end up as fugitives? We'll be
    chased by the government, and the probability that we'll get killed
    in the end is extremely high. I doubt anyone would submit to a plan
    like that. Don't forget. You don't know who your enemies are in this
    game. Blindly accepting everyone could ruin everything for you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    no one's—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    bad? Can you really say that, Shuya?&quot; Shogo's eyes grew stern.
    &quot;It'd be wonderful if everyone in this class were good. But if
    we're going to be realistic, we have to be careful. Think about it,
    you yourself were attacked by Yoshio Akamatsu and Tatsumichi Oki.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had told Shogo about Yoshio's assault when Shogo was stitching
    Noriko's leg. Shogo was absolutely right. He had no idea what Yoshio
    Akamatsu was thinking. He might have been trying to kill Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    sighed. His shoulders drooped down as he feebly mumbled, &quot;Then...then
    we're going to let most of our classmates, the good ones, just die.
    That's what this means, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    moved his chin up and down slightly, nodding. &quot;It's not easy,
    but yes. I don't know if it's going to be most of the class, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    fell silent for a while. Shogo lit another cigarette. He smoked too
    much. And he was a minor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Noriko said, &quot;Hey wait.&quot; Shuya looked back at Noriko. &quot;You
    said we might escape if everyone else dies, but we could also run out
    of time, if no one dies for twenty-four hours—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    Shogo nodded. &quot;That's correct.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;In
    that case, I guess your plan wouldn't work.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right. But I highly doubt that'll happen. Besides, if everyone can
    really get along and agree to my plan then they're totally welcome.
    But I doubt that'll happen. So there's really no need to worry about
    it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Apparently
    only 0.5% of the national Programs have ended due to time
    expiration.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    blurted out,&quot;'</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Apparently</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">'?
    How would you know?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on.&quot; Shogo again made a pushing gesture with his hands to stop
    Shuya. &quot;We have more urgent matters at hand. You haven't asked
    me what my plan is.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    fell silent. Then he asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged. Through the corner of his mouth, which was still holding
    the cigarette, he curtly replied, &quot;I can't tell you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knit his brows. &quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Not
    yet.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    just can't.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    do you mean, 'not yet'? Then when do you plan on telling us?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    suppose when it's just the three of us left. Let me just tell you one
    thing, though. My plan won't work if anyone tries to intervene. So my
    plan can't start until we're the only ones left.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    fell silent again. He stared at Shogo, who continued smoking, but
    then Shuya heard a voice whispering something inside his head. It was
    faint, but he could hear it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if he could hear this voice, Shogo grinned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know what you're thinking, Shuya. There might be something else going
    on here. I might be joining you just as a means for my own survival.
    In fact, I might not have a plan at all. Once we're down to three, I
    might kill you two and win the game. That would work out nicely for
    me, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was slightly intimidated. &quot;That's not—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    held his tongue and glanced over at Noriko. Noriko remained silent,
    staring at Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked back at Shogo.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It

    front and offered his shoulder to help Noriko up. Shogo glanced back
    at them, but said nothing and began walking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    they reached the end of the thicket, Shogo stood still. Shuya and
    Noriko too stopped walking.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    his back towards them, Shogo exclaimed, &quot;Why they're...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    walked up right behind Shogo, and like Shogo he and Noriko poked
    their heads out of the thicket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a mountain peak. There was a viewing platform between the trees
    scattered on the peak. It was probably five or six hundred meters
    away from the foot of the mountain, where they were. But they could
    still see it clearly. The platform was a crude construction,
    resembling a shack with a missing wall. There were two figures
    standing under its roof. Shuya's eyes widened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    voice reached them. &quot;Everyone. Stop fighting and come here—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    saw an object held in front of the taller figure's face—it was
    probably Yumiko's. Was it a megaphone? The one cops use to address
    criminals cooped up inside buildings under siege? It felt slightly
    absurd (&quot;Put down your weapons and come out with your hands
    up&quot;), but he could see how her voice could reach not only them
    but the rest of the island.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And
    the other one?&quot; Shuya whispered.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    replied, &quot;It's Yukiko. Yukiko Kitano. They're really close.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    is really bad,&quot; Shogo said with a grimace. &quot;They'll get
    themselves killed totally exposed like that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    bit his lower lip. Basically Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano were
    attempting to convince everyone they should stop fighting. They were
    doing what Shuya had considered but gave up on after he was attacked
    by Yoshio Akamatsu. They firmly believed no one really want to play
    the game. They chose that spot to be as visible as possible. Or maybe
    they were already near that location.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    sure no one wants to fight like this. So let's get together here—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    hesitated. He needed more time to process the situation—plus the
    conversation they were having hadn't been resolved. What if—it was
    unlikely—but what if Shogo was against them?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the end Shuya spoke to Shogo, &quot;Can you look after Noriko,
    Shogo?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    turned around. &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    going over there.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    knit his brows and said, &quot;What are you, stupid?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    putdown angered Shuya, but he simply answered, &quot;What do you
    mean? They're risking their lives doing this. They have no intention
    to play the game. They really don't. So they can join us. Besides,
    you just said they were endangering themselves.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    not what I meant.&quot; Shogo bared his teeth. It was an odd thing to
    notice, but they looked remarkably healthy. &quot;I just told you.
    It's best to stay put in this game. How far do you think that spot is
    from here? You have no idea who you'll encounter on the way.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know that!&quot; Shuya shot back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    you don't get it. Everyone knows about those two now. If anyone
    attacks them, then the enemy's going to wait for others offering
    themselves up like you. With more targets—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What
    gave Shuya the creeps wasn't so much Shogo's warning but his calm
    tone of voice.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Please—everyone
    come here. We're alone here—we're not fighting!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    slid his shoulder loose from Noriko's right arm.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    going.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    gripped the Smith &amp; Wesson and walked out of the bushes, but
    Shogo tugged on Shuya's left arm.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why!?&quot;
    Shuya's voice grew louder. &quot;You want me to just sit back and
    watch them get killed?&quot; He raised his voice uncontrollably and
    blurted out, &quot;Or is my leaving going to decrease your chances of
    survival? Is that it? Is that what's going on? Are you our enemy?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya,
    stop it...&quot; Noriko moaned, but Shuya wasn't finished—then he
    saw how calm Shogo looked even as he still held onto his arm.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    they hardly resembled each other, Shogo's composure reminded Shuya of
    the former superintendent of the Charity House, Ms. Anno's elderly
    father. After his parents died when he was still a kid, this man, who
    was the only authority figure and guardian he knew, sat down with
    him. He also wore the same kind of expression.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    said, &quot;It's none of my business if you want to die, but if you
    go now and don't return, then you'll drastically decrease Noriko's
    chances of survival. Have you forgotten that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath. Once again Shogo was right.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    calmly continued, &quot;I'm sure you must know this, Shuya...but
    loving someone always requires you to not love others. If you care
    about Noriko, don't go.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But...&quot;
    Shuya felt like crying. &quot;So what are you suggesting? We just let
    them get killed?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    didn't say that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    released Shuya and turned towards the peak where Yumiko continued her
    shouting. He held his shotgun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We'll
    be decreasing our chances of survival slightly. Only slightly.&quot;
    Shogo pointed the shotgun into the air and pulled the trigger. The
    gunpowder blast was ear-shattering. Shuya thought his eardrums had
    been blown out for a moment. The sound reverberated against the side
    of the mountain. Shogo's left hand pumped the shotgun, ejecting the
    spent cartridge. He followed with another shot. The sound rippled
    through the air.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    get it. The gunfire will scare off Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano,
    forcing them to stop and go hide instead.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko's
    voice, amplified by the megaphone, stopped. It felt as if Yumiko and
    Yukiko were looking down where they were. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But
    we're hidden by the bushes, so they probably can't tell who we are.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on! Shoot some more!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was riled up, but Shogo refused, &quot;No. Someone might have already
    figured out our location with those two shots. Any more could be
    fatal for us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    considered it. Then he tried to point his Smith &amp; Wesson into the
    air.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    once again tugged at his arm.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it! How many times do I have to tell you?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    can only hope they've hidden themselves now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked over at the peak. Then he heard it again. Once again, Yumiko
    Kusaka's voice shouted, &quot;Stop it! I know none of us want to
    fight—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook off Shogo's grip. He couldn't take it anymore. He wanted them
    to hide somewhere safe no matter what. He had his fingers on the
    trigger of the Smith &amp; Wesson when—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    of a sudden they heard a distant, rattling sound like that of rapid
    typewriter tapping. Then Yumiko's shriek, &quot;Urgh—&quot; reached
    them. Of course her cry was also amplified by the megaphone. After a
    moment's pause, &quot;AIEEE—&quot; a scream that sounded like it
    came from Yukiko Kitano. This too reached them courtesy of the cheap
    megaphone. Under the platform roof on the mountain peak, a tall
    figure appeared to collapse and Yukiko's screaming continued,
    &quot;Yumiko!&quot; followed by a loud thud, the sound of the
    megaphone hitting the ground. Shuya heard the rattling sound again
    but this time it was much quieter. Shuya realized the megaphone had
    also been picking up this sound as well. Once the megaphone was
    broken, the sound was drastically reduced. And now the figure of
    Yukiko also collapsed into the shadows of the short trees,
    disappearing along with Yumiko from their sight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    Kitano was crawling on the concrete floor of the viewing platform
    towards Yumiko Kusaka. Her stomach was burning, and she felt
    paralyzed, but somehow she managed to crawl towards her. Yukiko left
    a trail of red on the concrete, which was now a canvas of violent
    brushstrokes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yumiko!&quot;
    Yukiko let out a shriek that tore through her stomach, but she didn't
    care. Her best friend had fallen and was now motionless. That was
    what mattered to her now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    had fallen forward, facing Yukiko, but her eyes were closed. A gooey
    red pond began to ooze out from under her body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    Yukiko reached Yumiko, she struggled to lift her forward. Then she

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yumiko!
    Yumiko!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she shouted, a red mist sprayed into Yumiko's face, but Yukiko didn't
    even realize it was coming from her mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    slowly opened her eyes and gasped, &quot;Yukiko...&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No!&quot;

    on!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    frantically looked around. There was no trace of the assailant. They
    were probably shot at from a distance.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hurry!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    tried to raise Yumiko's body, but it was impossible. She immediately
    realized she could barely support her own body. The pain was much
    worse now, attacking her stomach as she shrieked and fell forward
    again. She still managed to face Yumiko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko's
    face was right in front of her eyes. Her glazed eyes stared at
    Yukiko. She asked in a feeble voice, &quot;You can't move, Yukiko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Nope,&quot;

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    could tell Yumiko was about to cry. Although Yukiko thought she
    wasn't seriously injured, she was now beginning to rapidly fade. Her

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yukiko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    was brought back by Yumiko's voice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There's
    something I didn't tell you when we were talking.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    smiled a little. &quot;I also had a crush on Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    a moment Yukiko didn't understand what Yumiko was talking about. She
    couldn't tell whether this was because it was so unexpected or
    because she was fading.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally
    though Yumiko's words knocked at the door of Yukiko's heart and
    entered. So...that's how it was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    as her mind sank into the mist, Yukiko remembered a scene. She and
    Yumiko had gone shopping together. It was a cheap ¥3,000
    bargain-sale item, but they'd found a pair of beautiful earrings, and
    although they hardly ever shared the same tastes—they ended up
    fussing over who really deserved these earrings. Finally they agreed
    to split the cost so that both of them would end up with one earring
    each.&nbsp;That was the first time they actually bought jewelry. And
    now, as always, that earring was tucked away in the drawer of her
    desk at home located near the border between Shiroiwa and the
    neighboring town.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    some reason, Yukiko felt incredibly content. It was strange, given
    how she was dying.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Really...&quot;
    Yukiko said. &quot;Really...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yumiko
    again smiled faintly. Yukiko opened her mouth just once more. She
    could say one last thing. It was true, she wasn't sure about
    religion, but if the Halo Church had ever offered her something
    beautiful it was Yumiko. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>We
    met at the church, and we've been together ever since.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yumi...ko.
    I'm so happy that we've been—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Yukiko was about to say &quot;friends,&quot; Yumiko's head shook with
    the sound of a bang. A red hole formed in her right temple—and now
    Yumiko merely gawked at her. The faraway look she had might have been
    unintentionally appropriate given their location, the viewing
    platform.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukiko
    opened her mouth in shock and horror when she heard another pop, this
    time accompanied by a blow to her head. It was the last sensation she
    ever felt.</font></font></p>

    this wasn't something Sakamochi and his crew cooked up. They don't

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    Seto (Male Student No. 12) was running frantically down the slope. He
    was on his hands and knees, so he was actually crawling through the
    bushes. His size-S black school coat covering his small body had
    nearly turned white from dirt. His large eyes had a childish
    innocence to them, but right now the class clown's face was contorted
    with fear.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    he'd left the school building and up until a few moments ago, Yutaka
    Seto had been hiding out in the bushes near the northern peak, in
    other words approximately fifty meters below from where Yumiko Kusaka
    and Yukiko Kitano were calling to everyone with their megaphone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    he was at an angle from them, Yutaka could see them clearly. He kept
    on hesitating, deliberating over what he should do, but finally right
    when he decided to join them, he heard the sound of distant gunfire.
    He thought he could see the two look in the opposite direction from
    him. Then as he hesitated over whether he should go check it out,
    within a matter of ten or twenty seconds he heard the sound of
    rapid-typewriter-rattling gunfire and Yumiko Kusaka's amplified
    shriek. He saw her fall. Then Yukiko Kitano was also shot down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were probably still alive at that point. But Yutaka just could not
    bring himself to come out and rescue them. After all he was a born
    jokester—fighting was just not his thing, and on top of that, his
    supplied weapon turned out to be a fork, the normal kind you would
    use to eat spaghetti. Then he heard a gun being fired twice,
    somewhere beyond his sight. He knew then that the assailant had
    finished off Yumiko and Yukiko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    moment he realized this he took his bags and slid down the side of
    the mountain. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    the next target! I know it! After all I'm the nearest one!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    of a sudden Yutaka realized he had created a cloud of dust all around
    him. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    no! No! This sucks! This blows more than your mama! Hey, now's not
    the time to come up with stupid jokes!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    then changed his approach, keeping his palms (his right hand held the
    fork, so it was clenched) and shoe soles on the ground to make sure
    his body wouldn't slide down the slope. He felt the skin of his hands
    scraping away, but he didn't care. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Damn,
    if someone saw me now they'd think it was funny. Ladies and
    gentlemen, the Human Beetle.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    moving forward like this for several minutes Yutaka finally stopped.
    Slowly he turned around. Through the trees he could make out the
    summit where Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano had been killed, but it
    seemed far. Everything was still. He strained his ears. There was no
    sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Did
    I escape? Am I safe now?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if answering his own question, something dug into his shoulder.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    froze up with fear and shrieked, &quot;Aieee!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    fool!&quot; Someone hissed as the grip on his shoulder relaxed and
    instead a clammy hand covered Yutaka's mouth. But Yutaka was
    completely oblivious to this voice, utterly convinced he was caught
    by the killer, and swung the fork in his hand in a fit of fear.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    fork made a clacking sound and stopped there...For some reason,
    nothing happened. Yutaka nervously opened his eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    figure in front of him was wearing a school coat. He'd blocked the
    fork with his large automatic pistol (Beretta M92F). He held the gun
    in his left hand. Given their respective positions, and the fact that
    he had his right hand over Yutaka's mouth, Yutaka's fork would have
    stabbed him pretty deep if he were right handed. But this guy was
    left handed. And there was only one left handed guy in Class B.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    was dangerous, Yutaka.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    front of his wet-looking hair was styled with gel. His eyebrows rose
    at a sharp angle, and beneath them were his piercing but humorous
    eyes. Finally there was the earring in his left ear. It was Yutaka's
    best friend, &quot;The Third Man,&quot; Shinji Mimura (Male Student
    No. 19), grinning at him and gently removing his hand from his mouth.
    Stupefied, Yutaka lowered his fork. Then he finally yelled out,
    &quot;Shinji! It's you Shinji!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    idiot!&quot; Shinji Mimura hissed at Yutaka, and once again shut
    Yutaka's mouth while he shouted from relief. Then he let go and said,
    &quot;This way. Don't say a word. Just follow me,&quot; and walked
    ahead of him into the low bushes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Yutaka followed him, dazed, he gradually saw how he had descended
    from the top of the mountain to the more level area below. Within a
    matter of minutes he'd covered a good distance.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    then glanced at Shinji Mimura's back. But then he was suddenly
    overwhelmed by a horrible idea and felt weak in the knees.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Maybe
    Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano were killed by...Shinji? Then the
    killer chasing Yutaka would be him! But then why hasn't he killed me
    yet? I mean, come on, I always thought of him as my best friend, and
    Shinji knows that. If we're together, Shinji could, for instance,
    have me keep watch and help him increase his chances of survival.
    Then, when we're the last two left, Shinji could kill me. Wow, what a
    great idea! If this was a video game, that's what I'd do...You jerk!
    What are you thinking!?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    shook off the thought. Shinji didn't have a machine gun—and nothing
    else could have made that sound. He was certain he didn't have one,
    and besides, most of all, this was Shinji. He was his best friend. He
    would never kill those girls off like that, as if they were flies.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    wrong, Yutaka?&quot; Shinji turned around and whispered. &quot;Hurry
    up.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    again Yutaka followed Shinji in a daze.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    continued to walk carefully. Once they covered a distance of
    approximately fifty meters he stopped. With his gun in his right
    hand, he pointed down toward his feet. &quot;You have to step over
    this here,&quot; he warned Yutaka. Yutaka narrowed his eyes and
    noticed a thin, dull piece of thread stretched tightly between the
    trees.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Is
    this—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    not a trap,&quot; Shinji said after stepping over the thread.
    &quot;There's an empty can tied to it over there. Once it's tugged,
    we can hear it fall.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded, eyes opened wide. Shinji had been hiding out. And this was a
    kind of tripwire alarm. Impressive. The Third Man was more than just
    a star athlete.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    stepped over the thread.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    reached a thicket twenty meters away. Shinji stopped walking. He said
    to Yutaka, &quot;Let's sit down.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    sat down, facing Shinji. He realized he was still holding his fork.
    He put it on the ground when all of a sudden he felt a stinging pain
    from his left palm and right fist. The skin had peeled off, revealing
    red flesh on his knuckles.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Seeing
    this, Shinji put down his gun and pulled out what appeared to be a
    day pack from a nearby bush. He took out his water bottle and towel,
    doused one end with water, and said, &quot;Give me your hands,
    Yutaka.&quot; Yutaka held them out, and Shinji wiped them thoroughly,
    but gently. Then he tore the dry part of the towel into thin shreds
    and wrapped them around Yutaka's hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Then he asked, &quot;So you've been
    hiding here?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    Shinji smiled and nodded. &quot;I caught a glimpse of you from here
    moving around in the bushes. You were pretty far away, but I could
    tell it was you. So even though it was a little risky, I went in your
    direction.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    choked up. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Shinji
    risked his life for my sake.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    dangerous if you don't move carefully.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh
    huh.&quot; Yutaka was about to cry.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Thanks
    so much, Shinji.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    glad...&quot; Shinji exhaled. &quot;Even if I die, I wanted to make
    sure I got to see you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    Yutaka's eyes were watering. He held his tears back though and
    changed the subject, &quot;I was...right near Yumiko and Yukiko. I-I
    wasn't able to help them.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    Shinji nodded. &quot;I saw that too—that's how I found you. Don't
    let it get you down. I wasn't able to do anything for them either.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded. Recalling how Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano were killed
    only moments ago, he trembled.</font></font></p>

    Noriko, and Shogo ended up moving approximately one hundred meters
    southwest of their previous position. By the time Shogo was done
    tying the wire around the bushes again, it was already 9 a.m. The sun
    was high in the sky, and the air smelled like a forest in May. The
    sea, which was visible as they moved through the trees, glistened a
    brilliant blue. Islands were scattered across the Seto Inland Sea. If
    they were hiking, this would have been a prime spot.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    they weren't. Every single boat that passed by circled around the
    island at a great distance, tiny as dots, and the nearest one was the
    gray guard ship in charge of the western region. Even that ship was
    pretty far, but you could see the machine gun installed at its head.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. After hesitating, he said, &quot;I mean it should have been
    obvious. They could have anticipated that. I mean, according to the
    rules of this game...&quot; he sighed, &quot;we're supposed to kill
    each other.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    put another cigarette between his lips and lit it with his disposable
    lighter. &quot;They seemed close. Weren't they in some religious
    group?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. They were very normal girls, but there was always something
    that separated them from the other girls, like Noriko and the neutral
    faction that included Yukie Utsumi and her friends. He thought it was
    because of their religion. &quot;They were part of some Shinto
    religious group called the Halo Church. They have a church located on
    the Yodo River bank, off the state highway when you're heading
    south.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    exhaled and suggested, &quot;Maybe that was part of it. You know,
    'Love thy neighbor.' &quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    I don't think so,&quot; Noriko said. &quot;They weren't— especially
    Yumiko—very committed. They said they didn't really get it, that it
    was just a social thing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    mumbled, &quot;I see,&quot; and looked down. Then he continued,
    &quot;Well, the good aren't always saved, and this game is no
    exception. It can be the irresponsible ones that end up making it.
    But I respect anyone who stands by their conscience, even at the risk
    of failing and being rejected by everyone.&quot; He stared back at
    them. &quot;They tried to believe in their classmates. They must have
    believed, if we could all get together, then we might end up being
    saved. We should commend them for that. We couldn't do that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath. Then he agreed, &quot;Yeah.&quot; After a while,
    Shuya looked up at Shogo again. &quot;I don't think...you're an
    enemy. So I want to trust you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    joined in, &quot;Me too. I don't think you're a bad person.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head and grinned. &quot;I have to tell you, I have no
    talent cheating girls.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    grinned back. Then he said, &quot;So why won't you tell us? No, if
    you can't tell us how we're escaping, that's fine. But why not? Is it
    in case we meet up with other people and tell them too much? Is it
    because the others can't be trusted? Or that you can't trust them?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    off on the interrogation. I'm not that smart.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    don't believe you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    rested his elbows against his knees, held his chin, and looked to his
    side in contemplation. Then he looked back at them. &quot;Shuya.
    You're right. I don't want the others to find out about my plan, and
    even if you two didn't tell them, I wouldn't want the others to even
    know that you two knew what it was. So I can't tell you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    Shuya thought about it, he exchanged glances with Noriko and nodded.

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Something

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya

    situation. So I'm—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Perplexed?&quot;
    Shuya nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    blew out some smoke and rubbed his cigarette into the ground. He ran
    his hand through his short hair and said, &quot;Nothing is perfect.

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    didn't understand. He squinted his eyes.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    continued, &quot;I know this game better than you two do.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How's

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    gave a blank stare and then smiled a little, asking again, &quot;How?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally
    Shogo said, &quot;Do you know what happens to the survivor of this
    game?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko looked at each other and shook their heads. That was
    right, there was one survivor in the Program. After you manage to
    make it through this absurd game, the Special Defense Forces soldiers
    shove you in front of the news cameras so they can have an image of
    the victor (&quot;Smile. You must smile.&quot;). But they had no idea
    what happened to the survivor after that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Shuya and Noriko and continued, &quot;The winner's forced
    to transfer to another school where he or she is ordered not to
    mention the game and is instructed instead to lead a normal life.
    That's all.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt his chest well up inside and his face froze. He stared at Shogo
    and realized that Noriko was holding her breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    said, &quot;I was a student in Third Year Class C, Second District,

    autographed by the Dictator. What an honor that was. It looked like
    some kid scribbled on it, though I can't remember the details, since
    I tossed it into recycling.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    sharp contrast to Shogo's cheery voice, Shuya took a deep breath. It
    was true any third-year junior high school student could get thrown
    into the Program, but how could you end up in it twice? Of course if
    he didn't have to stay back, it would never have happened, but even
    so the chances were as slim as winning the lottery. But now it all
    made sense how Shogo was so familiar with the game, how he noticed
    the sleeping gas, and of course, the scars all over his body...but if
    it was true it was completely outrageous.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's...&quot;
    Shuya said, &quot;that's outrageous.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged. &quot;The game was in July, but because I suffered heavy
    injuries, I was hospitalized for a long time. It gave me time though
    to study a bunch of things including stuff about this country—but
    only while lying in bed. The nurses and staff were really generous
    and brought me books from the library. I guess the hospital was my
    school. In any case, that was how I ended up repeating third year all
    over again. But...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo

    have to say, even I didn't expect I'd be in this game again.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course. Shuya recalled their recent—actually it was already three
    hours ago—conversation. When Shuya asked, &quot;Did you already
    kill someone before Kyoichi?&quot; and Shogo had answered, &quot;Well,
    this time, it was my first.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    then asked. &quot;So those who've been selected...&quot; She
    rephrased the question, perhaps thinking that it sounded too much
    like winning a sweepstakes prize, &quot;So the ones who've been in it
    already aren't exempt?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grinned. &quot;I suppose not, since I'm here. From what we're told,
    classes are chosen randomly by computer, right? My experience gives
    me the upper hand, but I guess the computer doesn't exclude me. So
    here's another case of perverted equality.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo

    Sakamochi (supervisor) was sitting at his faculty desk, rummaging
    through some scattered documents. To the north and south of him, a
    Special Defense Forces soldier stood by steel-plated windows equipped
    with gun ports. The lights inside stayed on because the building let
    hardly any sunlight in. Five or six soldiers were sitting at a desk
    facing Sakamochi, staring at a row of desktop computer monitors.
    Another three soldiers were wearing headphones connected to another
    machine that wasn't a computer. On the west wall was a large
    generator powering the lights, computers and other equipment. The
    generator's low hum filled up the room over the sound insulation. The
    other soldiers were taking a break in the room the students had been
    in.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes
    sir. This is Sakamochi, Superintendent. I appreciate all you've
    recently done for us. Yes sir. My second kid just turned two. Yes,
    and the wife's getting bigger by the day with the third. Oh, no.
    Well, we just want to contribute to our nation, joining the fight

    listened for a while, and then smiled, &quot;Ah ha. My oh my. So
    you've got your money on Shogo Kawada? I'm betting on Kazuo Kiriyama.
    I have my money on him. Well, yes, Shogo Kawada is serious
    competition. He has experience, which is almost unheard of. Of course
    he's still alive. And how are you, sir? My, that's impressive. Excuse
    me? The current status? I believe you have access to it on the

    still with those two?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The

    radar in the students' collars enabled them to plot out each

    frown at Kato's gruff attitude, but then realized how Kato was only
    one of the many problem students he'd had ever since he was a junior
    high school teacher, so it was nothing new. He picked up the
    receiver.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sorry
    to keep you waiting, sir. Let's see. Shogo Kawada is proceeding with
    two other students. That's Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa. Let's
    see. Well, they're actually talking about escaping together. Would
    you like to hear our recording of their conversations? Oh yes, sir.
    Hmm, I'm not sure if he is sincere. I mean it's hard to say, but I'd
    say it's a bluff. Probably. I mean it's impossible to escape. Oh, and
    yes, hold on, one moment, sir. Documents, documents. Yes, Shogo
    Kawada, right? He didn't appear to have been the controversial type
    at his previous school. No anti-government actions or statements.
    Yes. His father died during the previous game. Looks like his father
    got drunk and provoked the government...but apparently Kawada himself
    said, 'Good riddance. He was a bastard anyway.' Hmmm, they probably
    didn't get along. Maybe his father insisted on some compensation.
    Yessir. If that's so, then he's better off with those two than
    fighting alone. Shuya Nanahara is an excellent athlete, so he'll be
    useful. Although Noriko Nakagawa is injured. Yes, our Tahara shot
    her. Yes, of course. They totally trust Shogo Kawada. Helping an
    injured girl, I mean, how brilliant. His conversation has been most
    impressive.&quot;</font></font></p>

    right hand.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Whaaat?&quot;
    he replied. &quot;That can't be. I mean that occurred in March. I did
    receive the report. But if that's true, then right now...yessir. The
    central government officials are always prone to exaggeration.
    Besides, these are junior high school kids. Then they would have
    known we were listening in on them. Right now there are no signs that
    any of these students know this. Yessir. So...yes, yes, yessir. Very
    well then. Oh no, please, I couldn't possibly accept...well, if you
    must insist then, thank you very much, sir. Yes, yes.&nbsp;Well then,

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    Shinji first found Yutaka Seto, he seemed on edge from the shock of
    witnessing the deaths of Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano, but after a
    while he seemed to calm down. In a spot beyond the thick branches,
    where the warm sunlight poured in, Shinji Mimura was listening
    closely again. There didn't seem to be anyone else around. Only the
    sound of a little bird chirping. Whoever killed Yumiko and Yukiko
    didn't seem to have noticed Yutaka and Shinji. Still, he had to be
    careful.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Relax
    when you have to. But also be on your toes when you have to. The
    point is, make no errors of judgment.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    uncle had told him this. He was the one who taught him everything.
    Starting with basketball, he was the man most responsible for the
    education of the boy known as The Third Man. His uncle had also
    taught him computer basics. When his uncle showed him how to access
    foreign internet connections, he warned Shinji, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>you
    can never be too careful</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    And now was one of those times he had to be on his toes. That much
    was certain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    Shinji.&quot; Shinji looked back at Yutaka. Yutaka was leaning
    against a tree, hugging his knees, staring between them. &quot;Come
    to think of it, I should have been waiting for you in front of the
    school. Then we could have been together from the start.&quot; He
    looked up at Shinji. &quot;But I was too scared...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    crossed his arms with his Beretta in his left hand.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know about that. That might have been dangerous.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
    right</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Shinji realized, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Yutaka
    probably didn't know that Mayumi Tendo and Yoshio Akamatsu were
    killed in front of the school. Besides—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when he realized Yutaka was crying. His eyes were filled with
    tears which began to flow down his cheeks, tracing two thin, white
    lines down his dirty face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    wrong?&quot; Shinji asked kindly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I...&quot;
    Yutaka lifted his wounded fist and wiped his eyes with a strip from
    the towel Shinji had wrapped around his hand. &quot;I'm so pathetic.
    I-I'm a fool and a coward—&quot; He stopped and then said as if
    spitting up something stuck in his throat, &quot;I wasn't able to
    save her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    lifted his brow and glanced at his friend. This was something he
    didn't bring up, but since Yutaka did...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    said slowly, &quot;You mean Izumi Kanai.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded, still hunched over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    remembered being in Yutaka's room when Yutaka told him, with a mix of
    pride and embarrassment, &quot;I like Izumi Kanai.&quot; And Izumi
    Kanai ended up being one of the first to die. They were&nbsp;informed
    of her death by the 6 a.m. announcement. He had no idea where she
    died. He only knew she died somewhere on the island.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There
    wasn't anything you could do, though,&quot; Shinji said, &quot;Izumi
    left before you did.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    I...&quot; Yutaka continued, his head still hunched over. &quot;I
    couldn't even find Izumi. I was so scared...I thought, no, it
    couldn't happen to her, she's all right...I tried convincing myself.
    Then at six o'clock she was already...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    listened without saying a word. He heard the chirping again up in the
    treetops. There might have been another bird. The chirping
    overlapped, as if the birds were talking to each other.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    Yutaka looked up at Shinji. &quot;I made up my mind,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;About?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    eyes still wet, he directly looked at Shinji. &quot;Revenge. I'm
    gonna kill that bastard Sakamochi and the rest of the fucking
    government.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    was surprised. He stared at Yutaka.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course he was also totally pissed off at this game and the government
    that ran it. He didn't really know Shuya Nanahara's best friend
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu very well—he was a little too laid back for
    Shinji—but he was a nice guy. And the government brutally murdered
    him. Then Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, and now as Yutaka said, Izumi Kanai, and
    then others like Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano, killed right before
    their eyes, and then more classmates. But—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    you might as well be committing suicide.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't care if I die. What else can I do for Izumi now?&quot; Yutaka
    stopped and looked at Shinji. &quot;Is it ridiculous for a wimp like
    me to be saying this?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No...&quot;
    Shinji paused a bit and then shook his head. &quot;Not at all,
    Yutaka.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stared back at Yutaka and then looked up at the cluster of branches
    above them. He wasn't surprised by Yutaka's sudden emotional
    outburst, though it wasn't part of with his clownish persona. Here
    was another side of Yutaka. That's why they'd been friends for so
    long. But—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>&quot;I
    don't care if I die. What else can I do for Izumi now?&quot;</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    wonder what it's like to feel that way about a girl,</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Shinji wondered as he stared at the olive-colored layer of tree
    leaves shining brilliantly in the direct sunlight. He had dated girls
    and slept with three in fact (not bad for a junior high kid, huh?),
    but he'd never felt that way about a girl the way Yutaka did.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    it had something to do with his parents not getting along. His father
    saw another woman. (Apparently he was an excellent bureaucrat, but
    though it might have been presumptuous for his kid to be saying this,
    he was a vile man. It was unbelievable he could be the brother of
    Shinji's uncle, who radiated brilliance.) His mother couldn't hold
    anything against his father, and so whether it was flower arrangement
    or a women's group, she went from one hobby to another, lost in her
    own world. They had normal conversations. They did what was
    necessary. But they didn't trust each other, and they didn't help
    each other. Their mutual disgust accumulated as they grew
    older....</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Well
    maybe that was what most parents were like.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ever
    since Shinji Mimura became his school's star basketball player, he
    got popular with the&nbsp;girls—so going out with them was easy.
    Kissing them was easy. Then after a while sleeping with them was easy
    too. But he never fell in love with anyone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Regrettably
    Shinji had no opportunity to bring this up with his uncle who always
    had the right answer for everything. It only concerned him recently,
    and it was already two years since his uncle's death.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    earring in Shinji's left ear came from him. His uncle always had it
    with him. He told Shinji, &quot;The woman I loved wore this. She died
    a long time ago though.&quot; It was one of Shinji's prized
    possessions. After his uncle's death, he took it as a keepsake
    without anyone's permission. He could hear his uncle saying, &quot;You'll
    end up becoming jaded at that rate. It's not a bad thing to love
    someone and be loved by someone. Hurry up and find yourself a nice
    girl.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he still never found someone he could really fall for.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    remembered how his precocious sister, Ikumi, who was three years
    younger than him, asked, &quot;Do you want a romantic marriage or an
    arranged marriage?&quot; and how he'd answered, &quot;I may end up
    not getting married at all.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ikumi.
    Shinji thought of his sister. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    hope you fall in love with someone nice and have a good marriage. I
    might end up dying without knowing what it's like to be in love.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    looked back at Yutaka. &quot;Can I ask you something, Yutaka? I'll
    apologize in advance if it sounds offensive.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    looked blankly at him. &quot;What is it?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    was so great about Izumi?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    stared at Shinji and then his tear-drenched face broke into a smile.
    Maybe this would be his way of offering his bouquet of flowers to the
    dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know how to say it, but she was so pretty.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Pretty?&quot;
    Shinji repeated, then quickly added, &quot;I mean, I'm not saying she
    wasn't.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Izumi
    Kanai, well, she wasn't a dog for sure, but as far as pretty girls
    went, there was Takako Chigusa (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>oh,
    I guess she's my type</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">),
    Sakura Ogawa (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>well,
    she had Kazuhiko Yamamoto, and those two are gone</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">),
    and Mitsuko Souma (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>well,
    she's out of the question, no matter how pretty she is</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    then smiled a little again and said, &quot;When she looked drowsy and
    rested her cheeks on her hands, she was pretty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;When
    she was watering flowers by the classroom window, the way she touched
    the leaves, she was pretty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;When
    she dropped the baton at the annual field day and burst into tears
    afterwards, she was pretty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;When
    she was hanging out during our breaks, listening to Yuka Nakagawa,
    holding her stomach as she burst out laughing, she was so pretty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Ah.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he listened to these observations, Shinji suddenly felt like he
    totally understood. Yutaka's observations didn't explain anything,
    but it felt right. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hey
    Uncle, I think I actually might begin to understand what this is all
    about.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    Yutaka was done speaking he looked at Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    looked at him kindly and tilted his head slightly. Then he grinned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    thought you'd become a comedian when you grew up but now I think you
    could be a poet.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    smiled too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Shinji said, &quot;Hey.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know how to say this, but I think Izumi's really happy to know
    that someone loves her that much. She's probably crying right now up
    there in heaven.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Compared
    to Yutaka's poetic observations, his words sounded cheap, but he had
    to say it. But now Yutaka's eyes began to well up with tears again.
    The tears flowed down his cheeks again. They formed several white
    stripes on his cheeks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    think?&quot; Yutaka replied, all choked up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    extended his right hand toward Yutaka's shoulder and gently shook it.
    &quot;Of course.&quot; Shinji took in a breath and continued, &quot;And
    as for your revenge, I'm in.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    filled with tears, Yutaka's eyes opened wide. &quot;Really?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yep.&quot;
    Shinji nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes,
    it was something he'd been wondering about. No, not the stuff about
    girls. He wondered about his future in this shitty Republic of
    Greater East Asia.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    brought this kind of thing up with Yutaka once before. Yutaka said
    something like, &quot;I don't have a clue,&quot; and then added, &quot;At
    the very least I'll probably become a comedian.&quot; Shinji had
    laughed at Yutaka's facetious reply. But it was a serious concern for
    him. Actually, it must have been serious for Yutaka too. It was just
    that Yutaka chose not to bring it up. What it came down to was, as he
    had once said to Shuya Nanahara, &quot;This is what they call
    'successful fascism.' Where else in the world could you find
    something so sinister?&quot; This country was insane. Not just this
    stupid game, but anyone who showed even the slightest bit of
    resistance to the government was immediately discarded. The
    government couldn't care less even if you were innocent, and
    continued to cast an intimidating shadow over the lives of everyone
    who had no other choice but to obey its policies and who found
    consolation only in the small things that life had to offer. And even
    when their sources of happiness were taken away, well you just had to
    bow down and put up with it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shinji began to believe this was wrong, no matter what. No, everyone
    must have been thinking what he was thinking. But no one would come
    out with it. Even Shuya Nanahara let off steam by listening to that
    illegally imported rock music—it never went beyond that though.
    Shinji began to think he should protest, even if it was dangerous.
    The more he learned about the world, the more he began to hold this
    conviction.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    it happened, two years ago. His uncle's death. Officially it was
    reported as an accident. As they asked his family to claim his body,
    the police informed them he'd been electrocuted while working alone
    at night at his company's factory. But something had seemed wrong
    with his uncle for a while. His uncle seemed preoccupied, which was
    unusual for him—as usual, Shinji tapped on his uncle's computer,
    and then asked, &quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; His uncle was
    in the middle of replying, &quot;One of my old&nbsp;mates...&quot;
    but restrained himself and grew evasive, &quot;Oh no, it's really
    nothing.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Old
    mates.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    uncle hardly ever talked about the past. He'd always change the
    subject, and Shinji, realizing his uncle avoided talking about it,
    decided not to dig into his uncle's past anymore. (When he asked his
    father, who was his uncle's older brother, about it, he only replied
    that it was something Shinji didn't need to know.) Nevertheless, at
    the core of his wide range of knowledge that went beyond making legal
    and illegal distinctions, at the core of every explanation his uncle
    provided about the world or society, Shinji detected a profound
    disgust if not hatred towards their nation. And also...a shadow-like
    presence. Shinji had once told him, &quot;You're so great.&quot; His
    uncle only grimaced and replied, &quot;No, you're wrong. I'm not at
    all. You couldn't survive in this country if you really wanted to be
    good. I'd be dead if I were really a good person.&quot; That was what
    led Shinji to believe his uncle had fought against the government.
    But for some reason he stopped. That was what Shinji suspected.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was also why Shinji was disturbed when he heard his uncle mention his
    &quot;old mates.&quot; But this was his uncle, so he'd be fine, he
    assured himself and decided not to bombard him with questions.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    his concern turned out to be right on the mark. Shinji had suspected
    his uncle's &quot;old mates,&quot; with whom he'd lost touch, had
    gotten back in contact him. And though his uncle had probably
    hesitated, he decided to take on an assignment. And as a
    result...something happened. It was true that the police in this
    country had the right to execute civilians without any trial, so
    usually it wouldn't matter whether they shot you in an alley or at
    work. But when the person involved was related to someone important,
    then it wasn't unlikely they'd conspire to kill you in the form of an
    &quot;accident.&quot; Unfortunately, Shinji's father was a director
    at a well known firm (in other words, he was a first-class worker
    according to the Republic's employment ranking system— with the
    exception of a top-level government bureaucrat, it was the highest
    rank), and what was even more upsetting was that if this were true,
    then that worthless father of his had assisted, however indirectly,
    the government in &quot;taking care of&quot; his uncle like that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    couldn't have been accidental. His uncle would never die from
    electrocution. That was just too lame!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    original owner of his earring was probably linked to that part of his
    uncle's past. Outraged over his uncle's murder, Shinji swore he'd
    never bow down to this country.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course he knew that his uncle's statement, &quot;You couldn't survive
    if you really wanted to be good,&quot; was also a warning, which
    turned out to be true in the case of his uncle's own death. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>After
    all you've taught me, Shinji thought, I'm going to figure out how to
    do what you gave up on a long time ago. I...want to be good. That's
    what I learned from you after all.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he had no clear ideas and he hadn't really taken any action. He had
    heard of anti-government groups but he had no idea how to contact
    them. Besides, his uncle told him, &quot;It's best not to trust
    groups and movements. They're not very reliable.&quot; He also
    thought he was a little too young. And above all he was scared.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    now even if he were lucky enough to escape this stupid game he'd
    become a fugitive. Then—he came to the ironic conclusion—didn't
    that mean he could do as he pleased? Whether he did it in a group or
    on his own wouldn't matter. What mattered was that he could give all
    he had against this government now—this determination welled up
    inside him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    now, after talking to Yutaka, he was absolutely certain of it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Leaving
    aside this complicated stuff for the moment though, he decided to
    share his honest feelings on the other topic with Yutaka.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    really envy you for being in love with someone like that. So if
    you're going for it, I'm on your side.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka's
    lips began to tremble. &quot;Damn, really? You really will?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    I will.&quot; Shinji touched Yutaka's shoulder and added, &quot;But
    our first priority is to escape. Killing that bastard Sakamochi
    wouldn't even put a dent in the government. If we're going to go for
    it, we have to aim as high as we can, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded. Then he wiped his eyes.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    asked him, &quot;Did you see anyone other than Yukiko and Yumiko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    eyes red from rubbing, Yutaka looked at Shinji and shook his head,
    &quot;Nope. I...ran out of the school and kept on running. Did you
    see anyone, Shinji?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    nodded. &quot;When I first left—you probably don't know this
    but—Mayumi and Yoshio were killed in front of the school.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka's
    eyes opened wide. &quot;Really?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.
    Mayumi was probably killed right as she was leaving.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;...and
    Yoshio?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    answered with his arms folded, &quot;I think Yoshio was the one who
    killed Mayumi.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka's
    face stiffened again, &quot;...really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.
    Why else would Yoshio, the first one out, be there? Yoshio came back.
    Then, hiding in the shadows, he probably shot Mayumi....Since they
    both had arrows in their bodies, he must have tried to get rid of the
    next one... but instead his weapon— probably a bow gun, given those
    arrows—must have been taken by someone else, who then shot him.
    That's the most likely scenario.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Who
    was the next one though?...&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka's
    eyes widened again. &quot;Shuya? Shuya killed Yoshio?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shook his head. &quot;I don't know. The only thing we know is that
    Yoshio wasn't able to kill Shuya. So it was probably Shuya. But maybe
    Shuya just knocked Yoshio out. He's got a soft spot after all. And
    then Yoshio might have been killed by someone who came out later.&quot;
    Shinji thought about it and added, &quot;Besides, Shuya must have
    left with Noriko Nakagawa. He might not have had time to finish off
    Yoshio.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko?
    That's right, Noriko was shot. And you...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    Shinji grinned wryly. &quot;Getting the game delayed would have
    helped. I knew it was impossible but it was worth trying. Noriko came
    after Shuya. Shuya gave a clear signal to Noriko before he left. I
    could tell because I was near him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded. &quot;Noriko got shot so Shuya—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And
    given what happened to Yoshitoki—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded several times. He completely understood. &quot;I get it...Nobu
    had a crush on Noriko, right? So Shuya had to take care of Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.
    Well, even if that wasn't the case, given Shuya's personality, he'd
    probably planned on gathering everyone who came out after him. But
    after Yoshio's attack it was out of the question. Noriko was injured
    too. So he probably just took off with Noriko as his only partner.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded again. Then he looked down. &quot;I wonder where Shuya is.
    We'd be so strong if Shuya and you were together.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    raised his brow. Yutaka might have been recalling their powerful
    combinations when they were paired up in class games. It was true,
    Shinji also thought, Shuya Nanahara would be a great partner. It
    wasn't just his athletic talent. Just like Shinji, Shuya was daring
    and fearless, with the ability to respond under pressure. He was one
    of the few classmates he could rely on in this situation. An honest
    guy like him—and as far as Shinji was concerned a little too
    spacey—could never kill his classmates.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    placed his right on Yutaka's shoulder. Yutaka lifted his face. &quot;I'm
    just glad I'm with you. I'm so glad we're together.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    was once again on the verge of bursting into tears. Shinji gave him a
    reassuring smile. Yutaka held back his tears and smiled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    continued, &quot;Enough about the dead. I noticed something. You know
    how the woods are right in front of the school athletic field?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There
    was someone there. A group of students.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;...really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.
    I think they were waiting for someone. Of course, there were only
    five students left after me. Kyoichi Motobuchi, Kazuhiko Yamamoto,
    Chisato Matsui, Kaori Minami, and Yoshimi Yahagi. Anyway, they didn't
    make any attempts to call out to me. It was a group, so I doubt they
    would have been hostile right off, but I didn't have any particular
    reason to seek them out and join them, either. You just said you
    should have waited...but under the circumstances that would have been
    impossible. The fact is that Yoshio probably came back and killed
    Mayumi. I was thinking that if someone came back there and found that
    group in the woods they'd be finished. Of course, they might have
    been armed. Anyway, I booked out of there.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stopped. After moistening his lips with the tip of his tongue, he
    went on, &quot;I also saw two other students.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka's
    eyes opened wide again. &quot;Really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    nodded. &quot;I moved around a lot last night. And one of them was a
    girl. You know she has that weird hair that stands up—so I think it
    was Hirono. While I was checking out the foot of the mountain, I saw
    her moving beyond those bushes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    didn't call out to her?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shrugged. &quot;I don't know. I guess I'm prejudiced against her. I
    just don't trust Mitsuko's friends.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    other one I saw was Shogo Kawada.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    opened his mouth as if to say, wow. He exclaimed, &quot;Shogo-san,
    huh.&quot; Just like his classmates Yutaka politely referred to Shogo
    as &quot;Shogo-san.&quot; &quot;He's a little intimidating so—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    well, that's why I avoided him. But...&quot; Shinji glanced up at the
    sky. Then he looked back at Yutaka. &quot;He seemed to notice me. I'd
    just left a house where I was searching for some stuff. He was there,
    around the house, but he immediately took cover in the path between
    the fields. I think he was carrying a shotgun. I hid behind the
    door...I think he was checking me out for a while. But then he
    disappeared. He didn't try to attack me at all.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    responded, &quot;Huh. Then that means he's not an enemy.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shook his head. &quot;Not necessarily. He might have seen my gun and
    decided he was better off not attacking me. In any case, I decided
    not to follow him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see...&quot; Yutaka nodded, but then looked up as if he'd realized
    something. &quot;I know I haven't seen anyone, but I could've sworn I
    heard another gun go off before Yumiko and Yukiko were shot.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    nodded. &quot;I heard it too.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It
    wasn't a machine gun. Do you think it was aimed at them too?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,&quot;
    Shinji shook his head. &quot;I don't think so. I think whoever fired
    it did it to stop them. It was so obvious what they were doing was
    risky. The shooter wanted to scare them with the gunfire so they'd
    run and hide.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    leaned forward excitedly, &quot;The-then that shooter isn't an
    enemy.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah
    well, we don't have any way to hook up. Even though I have a rough
    idea where the gunshot came from, the shooter's probably already on
    the move—since the machine gun shooter knows where he is too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Disappointed,
    Yutaka drew back. They fell silent while Shinji continued thinking,
    his arms folded. Shinji wanted to know if Yutaka had seen anyone they
    could trust. He thought they could hook up with a classmate if he or
    she hadn't moved, but come to think of it, he'd trust anyone Yutaka
    would trust, so if Yutaka had seen others who were trustworthy Yutaka
    would have been with them by now. But Yutaka was alone. So the
    question was pointless.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    in any case, who could he trust? Shuya...and then maybe Hiroki
    Sugimura? The rest were girls. He could probably trust the class
    representative, Yukie Utsumi, and her friends, but he didn't have a
    good reputation with the girls in his class, probably because he
    slept around. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Ah
    well. Hey Uncle, I should have found a steady girlfriend, huh?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    how lucky was he to hook up with Yutaka? He could absolutely trust
    him.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    asked him, &quot;Hey Shinji. You said you were looking for
    something.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    nodded. &quot;I did.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    was it? What were you looking for? A weapon? I was too scared. It
    never even crossed my mind.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    looked down at his watch. It should be done by now. An hour had
    elapsed since the machine began its password search.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    got up and tucked his gun in front. &quot;Yutaka, can you move over?&quot;
    Yutaka moved away from the tree he was leaning against. Beyond it,
    there were bushes spreading out over the ground, forming a thicket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    walked over there and stuck his arms into the bushes. Carefully he
    pulled out the accessories and cables together.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    looked astonished.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    had pulled out a car battery (the power source), a partially

    on the southern end of the residential area of the island, so it was
    far from the house where Megumi Eto was killed, but Yoshimi had no
    idea Megumi had died there anyway. She just heard her name in this
    morning's announcement.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was more preoccupied with the forbidden zone announced this morning.
    At 11 a.m. all collars in sector H-8, which included the houses here,
    would explode. The computer would not respond to pleas for it to
    wait.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rear entrance faced a narrow alley that ran between the houses.
    Yoshimi held the heavy automatic pistol (Colt Government Model .45)
    with both hands, pulling back the tight hammer with her right thumb.
    She quickly checked the premises. There was no one in the alley in
    either direction.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even
    though as a member of Mitsuko Souma's gang she was considered a
    &quot;delinquent,&quot; her round face had a childish quality. Right
    now though, it was breaking out in a cold sweat. It was only an hour
    or two ago that she saw from the second floor window Yumiko Kusaka
    and Yukiko Kitano calling on everyone to join them. Then the rattling
    machine gun. No doubt about it. The killing was continuing. Not
    everyone was hiding out like she was. There were others willingly
    killing their classmates. And it was impossible to know where they
    might show up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    stepped out and cautiously tiptoed to her right with her back pinned
    up against the wall of the house&nbsp;where she had been hiding. She
    turned south at the corner and saw a field extend up a gentle slope.
    The mild slope was covered with patches of green and headed up to the
    southern mountain. The houses there weren't as crowded together as
    they were here. She decided it was best for her to reach the southern
    mountain. Then she'd be safe for the time being.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    shouldered her day pack, checked around again, then ran out to the
    small thicket by the field.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    reached it in a matter of seconds. Holding her gun with both hands,
    she pointed it left and right, but no one was there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    was already panting after that brief excursion. She had further to
    go, though, to get out of sector H=8. She actually might be beyond
    the border, but it wasn't as if there was a white line running on the
    ground. It was best to err on the side of caution. Otherwise she'd go
    nuts. There were blue dots on the map indicating houses and the group
    of houses where she was was cluttered up with so many dots she had no
    idea exactly where she was. The sector border was at the edge of this
    clutter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    felt like crying. If she wasn't in Mitsuko Souma's gang then she'd
    have probably found someone, yes, some nice girl she could trust, and
    joined up with her. But no one trusted her. Well, she'd done some bad
    things with Mitsuko Souma and Hirono Shimizu. Stealing from, even at
    times terrorizing her classmates. No one would believe her even if
    she insisted she meant no harm. They might attack her on sight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    she hid in the house last night she saw another girl heading in the
    opposite direction. She was leaving the residential area. Was it
    Kayoko Kotohiki (Female Student No. 8)? Maybe she'd first hid in the
    residential area but then decided against it and moved on. (Her
    decision proved a good one, since the area became the game's first
    forbidden zone.) It was a perfect opportunity to contact someone,
    given the timing and proximity, but Yoshimi just couldn't bring
    herself to do it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    what about Mitsuko Souma and Hirono Shimizu? It was true they were
    bad—but they were her friends after all. If she could find them,
    would they trust her? And could she trust them? No, she probably
    couldn't.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overwhelmed
    by despair, she thought of a certain boy's face again. It was the
    same face she'd been thinking of ever since the game began. The one
    who said he didn't care she was with Mitsuko Souma, he still liked
    her. He kissed her gently on the bed and kindly warned her, &quot;Stay
    out of trouble.&quot; The boy who made her believe she could actually
    change.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    she left the school building, she thought he might be waiting for
    her. But of course there was no one there. Of course there wouldn't
    be. There were the corpses of Mayumi Tendo and Yoshio Akamatsu lying
    on the ground, though. Chances were if you stuck around you'd end up
    like them. (She had no idea where their killer had gone.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Where
    could he possibly be right now? Or was it too late...&nbsp;</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    felt her chest tighten. Her eyes filled with tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her sailor suit and moved through
    the thicket towards its edge. She had to move a little further ahead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    holding the gun, she looked for her next source of shelter. Now there
    were several tall trees bunched together on her right with dense,
    tall weeds all over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    ran across the field again. Her face was scratched by a small branch
    as she slid into the edge of the&nbsp;thicket. She got up slowly and
    looked around. She couldn't see completely through the thick green
    shrubbery, but no one was in sight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    still kept low as she crept forward in the thicket. It was all right,
    it was all right, no one was in the area.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    reached the edge of the thicket. Now the greenery of the southern
    mountain was right in front of her. Large and small trees and also a
    dense grove of what looked like bamboo. It looked like there were
    plenty of places to hide there. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>All
    right, all right, then I just have to get there...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    she heard a rustling sound behind her. Her heart leaped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    lowered herself, holding the Colt .45 in her hands, and slowly turned
    around. The hair on the back of her neck was standing straight up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    caught a glimpse of a black school coat moving between the trees
    approximately ten meters away. Her eyes opened wide with fear.
    Someone was over there. Someone!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    clenched her teeth to contain her fear and lowered her head. Her
    heart was pounding.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    heard another rustling sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    wasn't anyone in the thicket just a moment ago. Someone had come here
    after her. Why? Was this person after her?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    turned pale.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No,
    not necessarily. The student might just be on the move like her. If
    she'd been noticed, he or she would have come right after her. She
    hadn't been noticed yet. Then it was best to let him pass. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Don't
    move. Just don't move.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was the rustling sound again. The person was moving again. Crouching,
    Yoshimi could see between the dense leaves the figure moving through
    the woods. Revealing its profile, it moved from Yoshimi's right to
    her left. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    yes!&nbsp;He's not headed towards me...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she sighed though, she suddenly did a double take.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    figure was too far into the trees to see. The rustling sound
    gradually became distant.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    couldn't be wrong. Was she just hallucinating out of panic? No, that
    couldn't be.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    stood up, hunched over, and proceeded to follow the sound. Moving
    several meters ahead, she looked toward the source of sound in the
    shade of the dense leaves. In her narrow field of vision she was able
    to make out the school coat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    put both of her hands on her chest. Had it not been for the gun she
    held in her hands, she would have looked like she was praying.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Yoshimi was praying, no doubt. If there were a god who could bring
    about such a miraculous turn of events, then she was thanking it. She
    held no particular religious beliefs, but it didn't matter which god
    it was. She was grateful. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    God thank you! I love you!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    blurted out as she stood up, &quot;Yoji!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    Kuramoto (Male Student No. 8) trembled for a moment, but then turned
    around slowly. His face had a Latin look. His thick-lashed eyes
    opened wide and then returned to their normal size. For a split
    second his face seemed to turn blank, but she was convinced it was
    just her mind playing tricks on her. The face then formed a smile.
    The smile of the boy who loved her more than anyone else.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yoshimi—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yoji!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding
    her day pack and Colt .45 in her right hand, Yoshimi ran toward Yoji.
    Her eyes filled with tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    held Yoshimi in his arms, gently, but also with reassurance in the
    tiny space of the thicket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    without saying a word Yoji kissed her on the lips.&nbsp;He kissed her
    eyelids. The tip of her nose too. It was how Yoji always kissed her.
    It might not have been appropriate, given the circumstances, but she
    was ecstatic.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    kissing her he looked into her eyes and said, &quot;So you were safe.
    I was worried about you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remaining
    in each other's arms, Yoshimi responded, &quot;Me too, me too.&quot;
    Tears came rolling out of the corners of her eyes and down her
    cheeks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    Yoji left the classroom before her, he took a glance at Yoshimi, who
    was on the verge of crying as she watched him leave. She had left
    too, and dawn came. And she had been terrified every single moment
    until now. But now she was with someone she thought she'd never see
    alive again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I-it's
    a miracle,&quot; Yoji said, somewhat belatedly, as if he were in
    shock. &quot;It really is. I can't believe it. I thought we'd never
    see each other again. In this horrible...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    gently brushed his hands through Yoshimi's hair while she cried.
    &quot;It's going to be all right now. We'll stay together no matter
    what happens.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji's
    words sounded reassuring and tears came gushing out from her eyes.
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
    rules only allowed one survivor, but I get to be with the one I love
    most. There was something about a time limit, but we'll just stay
    together until time runs out. If someone attacks us, Yoji will
    protect us. Oh God tell me I'm not dreaming.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    remembered everything that happened between them since she met Yoji
    in their second year, when they ended up classmates. That special
    autumn day, when they bumped into each other on the street and
    decided to go to a movie together, then Christmas, then the
    strawberry shortcake they ordered and split at the cafe, that night's
    kiss, New Year's, dressing up in a long-sleeved kimono for the first
    temple visit (the sacred lot she drew was only &quot;fair luck.&quot;
    while his was &quot;very good luck,&quot; and he gave her his), and
    the unforgettable Saturday, January 18th, the night she spent at
    Yoji's house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Where
    have you been?&quot; Yoshimi asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    pointed to the group of houses. &quot;In a house over there. But you
    know this collar—if I stay there, it's supposed to explode. So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    looked serious, but Yoshimi thought it was funny. They were right
    near each other! She'd been wondering ever since the game began where
    could he be, only to find out he was right nearby.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    up?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    was hiding in one of those houses too. We were probably right next
    door to each other.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    laughed. Yoshimi realized how wonderful it was to share a laugh with
    someone you loved. It might be considered trivial, but no, it was
    essential. And now it was hers once again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    slowly let go of Yoshimi. His eyes suddenly fell on her right hand.
    Realizing she was still holding the gun, she burst out, &quot;Ha ha
    ha. I forgot...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    also smiled. &quot;Nice weapon. Look what I ended up with.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    showed her what he'd been holding. She hadn't noticed it at all. On
    closer look, she saw that it was a dagger, the kind you might see in
    an antique store. The strip of thread wrapped around the grip was
    worn out, the oval-shaped guard had turned greenish blue, and as Yoji
    revealed by pulling the dagger out of its sheath, the blade was
    spotted with rust. Yoji returned the blade to its sheath and tucked
    it in his belt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    let me check that out,&quot; Yoji said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&nbsp;She
    offered the gun to him. &quot;You hold onto it. I doubt I can do much
    with it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    nodded and took the Colt .45. He held the grip and checked the
    safety. He pulled the slide, revealing the first bullet in the
    chamber. The hammer was still cocked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    have bullets for this?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    gun's cartridge was fully loaded. Yoshimi nodded, took the box of
    bullets out of her day pack, and handed it over to him. Yoji took it
    with one hand, opening it up with his thumb to check the contents.
    Then he tucked it into his uniform pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    of a sudden...Yoshimi couldn't believe her eyes. She was completely
    clueless as to what was going on—as if she were watching some
    baffling magic trick—as she looked at Yoji's hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    was pointing the Colt .45 at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yoji?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    repeating his name, she saw how Yoji had become a different person.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    face was contorted. The thick-lashed eyes, the large hooked nose, his
    wide lips—each part of his face looked the same as before, but
    she'd never seen this expression with its twisted mouth, revealing
    its teeth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    contorted mouth spat out these words, &quot;Go away. Get out of
    here!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    didn't understand what he meant.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    sounded irritated. &quot;I said get away from me!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    in a daze, her lips quivered, &quot;Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if fed up with her, Yoji cried out, &quot;You expect me to be with a
    bitch like you!? Get out of here, bitch!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    inside of Yoshimi began to crumble, first slowly, then quickly.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why?&quot;
    Yoshimi's voice trembled. &quot;Did I...did I do something wrong?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    gun was still aimed at her. Yoji spat to his side.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Give
    me a break. Even I know you're a slut. I know you've been arrested by
    the cops. On top of that you slept with a guy old enough to be your
    dad. I know that too! You expect me to trust a bitch like you!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi's
    jaw dropped as she stared at Yoji's face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was all true. She'd been arrested several times for stealing, and the
    police had taken her in once for blackmailing a high school student.
    And then there was...prostitution. A while ago Yoshimi had slept with
    some middle-aged men Mitsuko Souma had introduced her to. The money
    was good, she wasn't the only one doing it, and at that time of her
    life she was getting so fed up with everything. So wearing makeup
    she'd never worn, acting like an adult, and being with men who seemed
    in their own way generous—it didn't seem like a bad thing. Yoshimi
    assumed Yoji had known all this about her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ever
    since she started dating Yoji that autumn day, she had put an end to
    all of that. Of course she continued being friends with Mitsuko Souma
    and Hirono Shimizu. It wasn't like she was suddenly a star pupil, but
    she did stop prostituting herself, and she did her best to keep
    herself out of trouble. And she'd believed Yoji forgave her and loved
    her anyway.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    tear rolled down Yoshimi's cheek.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I-I
    stopped doing that.&quot; Different tears began streaming down her
    cheeks. &quot;I wanted to be...I wanted to be good to you, Yoji.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    stared at Yoshimi as if her words had completely shaken him up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then his expression returned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    liar! Stop pretending to cry!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    stared at Yoji with her wet eyes. Words came tumbling out,
    &quot;Then...then why did you go out with me?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    immediately replied, &quot;Come on, I thought a slut like you'd be
    easy! Get out of here! Bitch!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    prompted by some force, Yoshimi ran towards Yoji. It might have been
    because she couldn't bear listening to Yoji anymore, or maybe it was
    because she couldn't deal with the fact that Yoji was pointing a gun
    at her. &quot;Stop it! Please stop it!&quot; she cried and tried to
    grab the gun from his hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    quickly dodged her and shoved her. The day pack slid off her shoulder
    down to her left hand, and Yoshimi fell back on the grass.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    pinned Yoshimi down.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    the hell are you doing!? Bitch! You tried to kill me! I'll kill </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>you</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    bitch!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    pointed his gun at her while Yoshimi frantically grabbed his right
    wrist with both her hands. Yoji immediately shifted the gun from his
    right hand to his left. Yoji's hand moved slowly downward. To her
    forehead! Yoshimi felt her heart pounding.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    stuck out her hands and cried in desperation.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yoji!
    Please! Please stop it, Yoji!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji
    said nothing. His bloodshot eyes glared down at her. His arm came
    down methodically, like a machine. Five more
    centimeters...four...three...the bullet could now brush her hair. Two
    more centimeters, and...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Though
    she was torn up with sadness and fear, a thought suddenly occurred to
    her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    understood everything now. She didn't want to, but it turned out the
    person she adored was only an illusion. Still...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still,
    it was a wonderful illusion. With Yoji, she thought she could start
    over. It was Yoji who gave her that illusion. Without Yoji she would
    never have believed it could happen.</font></font></p>

    that time we ate ice cream at the only burger joint in Shiroiwa...</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">she
    had ice cream on her nose and Yoji said, &quot;You are so cute.&quot;

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    suddenly relaxed her arms. Yoji cocked the gun and placed it against
    her forehead. His finger was ready to pull the trigger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    stared back at Yoji and quietly said, &quot;Thank you, Yoji. I was so
    happy being with you.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji's
    eyes opened wide and remained frozen, as if he'd suddenly realized
    something important.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Go
    ahead...shoot me.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    smiled warmly and closed her eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Pointing
    the gun at her, Yoji began to tremble.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    waited for the burning bullet to pierce her head, but the gun
    wouldn't fire.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Instead
    she heard his hoarse voice, &quot;Yoshimi...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    slowly opened her eyes again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    met Yoji's. Through the thin film of her tears, she saw how his eyes
    were now those of her beloved Yoji. They were even filled with
    remorse and self-reproach.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Ah—</i></font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	TUNK!
    It was a pleasant but somewhat strange, damp sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Simultaneously,
    Yoji's right finger pulled the trigger. But it was on accident, the
    result of his finger's reflex. The gunshot exploded like a
    firecracker and made her shriek, but the muzzle had already been
    pointed away from her, and the bullet lodged into the patch of grass
    above her head. A tiny cloud of dirt rose in the air.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoji's
    lifeless body fell on top of Yoshimi. He remained motionless.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she tried to pry herself loose, she saw someone smile over the
    shoulders of Yoji's black school coat. It was her old partner in
    crime, Mitsuko Souma.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    had no idea what was going on. She only knew that the smile on this
    angelic, adorable, beautiful&nbsp;face absolutely terrified her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    asked Yoshimi if she was all right as she grabbed her hand and pulled
    her out from under Yoji's body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    staggered to her feet in the bushes and looked down. An extremely
    sharp sickle (a sickle! as one of the more urban girls in Shiroiwa,
    Yoshimi had never seen one before) was planted in the back of Yoji's
    head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Leaving
    aside the sickle for now, Mitsuko immediately went for the Colt .45
    in Yoji's right hand. His muscles had tightened, so she had to pry
    each stiff finger loose. The gun was finally in her hands, and she
    grinned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    looked down at Yoji's lifeless body, trembling. She was trembling
    violently. Uncontrollably. In one flourish she had just lost someone
    incredibly important to her. It was like the sensation she had when a
    precious glass ornament she had as a child accidentally fell and
    shattered on the floor. But...this was far more precious.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    came to her senses and looked at Mitsuko (of course she had been
    looking at her all this time, but she was too incapacitated to
    process this visual information), who proceeded to wrestle with the
    sickle to dislodge it from the back of Yoji's head. She gripped the
    handle with both hands and tried shaking it loose, swinging Yoji's
    head along with it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    screamed and shoved Mitsuko aside. Mitsuko fell back onto the grass,
    exposing her well formed legs, from the hem of her pleated skirt up
    to her thighs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    shielded Yoji's body. The sickle was still planted in his skull. Her
    tears fell onto his body. The sickle was telling her: </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>shaking
    me won't revive me, don't shake me, there's a sickle stuck in me,
    man, that hurts.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    chest tightened with waves of remorse. She felt as if she were
    drowning, as if the world were coming to an end.&nbsp;She thought of
    the cause behind all of this, and her tearstained eyes glared
    fiercely at Mitsuko. If looks could kill, her glare would have.
    Yoshimi couldn't care less now what kind of game this was or who her
    enemies and allies were. If anyone was her worst enemy, it was
    Mitsuko Souma, who'd killed her love.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why'd
    you kill him!?&quot;&nbsp;The words sounded empty to Yoshimi. She
    felt as if she had become a hollow bag in a human shape. But the
    words came pouring out. The human body could do strange things.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why!
    Why'd you kill him!? It's horrible! It's just too awful! You're evil!
    Why'd you have to kill him!? Why!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    contorted her mouth in an expression of dissatisfaction. &quot;You
    were about to get killed. I saved you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No!
    I got Yoji to understand me! You're so evil! I'll kill you! I'll kill
    you! Yoji understood me!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    shook her head and shrugged, pointing the .45 at her. Yoshimi's eyes
    opened wide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    so Yoshimi heard the dry pop one more time. Her forehead felt as if
    it were being crushed by a car. That was all.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshimi
    Yahagi fell onto the corpse of her beloved Yoji Kuramoto and remained
    motionless. The .45 caliber bullet had demolished the back of her
    head. But her mouth remained open as if she were screaming and blood
    came flowing out from its side. It soaked Yoji's school coat, oozing
    out into a dark patch.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    lowered the smoking Colt .45 and shrugged again. She'd planned on
    using Yoshimi to shield her from bullets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    leaned over and whispered into the ear of Yoshimi's half-destroyed
    head, &quot;I'm sure he understood.&quot; There was a strange topping
    of gray jelly brains and blood on her earlobe. &quot;I killed him
    because it looked like he wasn't going to kill you after all.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then,
    once again, she proceeded to pry loose the sickle from Yoji's head.</font></font></p>

    spoke up, &quot;Look, as long as you trust me, it's cool but...like I

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya

    pretty quickly, and I didn't have any time to hook up with anyone.

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded, &quot;Yeah. I would have done something against this country
    eventually.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Like
    what?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    only grimaced. &quot;I wonder.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;It's
    not so easy bringing down a system that's already built up. But I
    would have done something. Well no, I'm still going to. That's why I
    have to survive this time too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked down at the revolver and looked up. Another question had
    occurred to him.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Can
    you tell me something?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    the purpose of this game? How could this serve any useful purpose?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    eyes widened, but then he looked down and began to chuckle. He found
    it funny. Then he finally said, &quot;There is no purpose.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    raised her voice. &quot;But they insist it has some military
    purpose.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    kept on smiling and shook his head. &quot;That's just crazy nonsense.
    Of course this whole country's insane, so maybe it's completely
    rational.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt a rush of anger once again as he spoke, &quot;Then how could
    this go on for so long?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    easy. Because there's no one speaking out against it. That's why it's
    still going on.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Seeing
    how Shuya and Noriko were at a loss for words, Shogo added, &quot;Look,
    this country's run by a bunch of idiot bureaucrats. In fact you have
    to be an idiot to be a bureaucrat. My guess is that when this lovely
    game was first proposed—some crazy military strategist probably
    came up with it—there was no opposition. You don't want to stir
    things up by questioning the specialists. And it's terribly difficult
    to end something that's already been established. You interfere, and
    you're out of a job. No, worse yet, you might be sent to a forced
    labor camp for ideological deviation. Even if everyone were against
    it, no one could say it out loud. That's why nothing changes. There
    are a lot of screwed up things in this country but they all boil down
    to the same thing—fascism.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Noriko and Shuya. He added, &quot;You two, and the same
    applies to me, we cant say anything. Even if you think something's
    wrong, your life is too precious to risk it by protesting, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    couldn't say anything back. His hot flash of anger all of a sudden
    went cold.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    shameful,&quot; Noriko said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at Noriko. Noriko looked down sadly. He agreed. He felt the
    same way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Did
    you know there was a country called the South Korean People's
    Republic?&quot; Shogo asked. Shuya looked at Shogo, who was staring
    at a pink azalea flower on a tree branch right in front of them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    seemed irrelevant, but Shuya answered anyway, &quot;Yeah, it was the
    southern half of the current Democratic Nation of the Korean
    Peninsula, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	You
    could learn about what was known as the South Korean People's
    Republic and the Democratic Nation of the Korean Peninsula—and the
    civil strife between the two Korean nations immediately west of the
    Republic of Greater East Asia's inland sea—in a textbook: &quot;Although
    our relations with SKPR were cordial, due to conspiracies concocted
    by the imperialists of the United States and the DNKP, the SKPR was
    annexed by the DNKP.&quot; (Of course, following this explanation,
    the summary would continue, &quot;Our nation must immediately oust
    the Korean Peninsula imperialists and annex this country not only for
    the freedom and democracy of the Korean people, but in order to
    progress towards our goal in attaining the co-existence of Greater
    East Asia peoples.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right,&quot; Shogo nodded. &quot;That country was just like ours. An
    oppressive government and dictator, ideological propaganda,
    isolationism, and information control. And support for snitching. It
    failed though after forty years. But the Republic of Greater East
    Asia is doing quite well. Why do you think that is?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought about it. He hadn't really given it much thought, but the
    textbooks explained South Korea's defeat as &quot;a cunning
    conspiracy instigated by the imperialists including the American
    imperialists&quot; (The vocabulary employed in these textbook
    explanations was beyond junior high level.) But then why was the
    current Greater East Asia still prosperous? Of course the SKPR was
    geographically located right next to the DNKP but...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    shook his head. &quot;I don't know.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Shuya and nodded. &quot;First of all, it's a question of
    balance.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Balance?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes.
    The SKPR was totalitarian—of course, this country is essentially
    totalitarian. But it&nbsp;employs a subtle, well, this just might
    have been a fortunate result, but it skillfully managed to leave
    little bits of freedom intact. By providing this kind of candy, they
    can proclaim, 'Of course, every citizen has the right to freedom.
    However, freedom must be controlled for the sake of the public good.'
    The claim actually sounds legit, huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko silently waited for Shogo to continue.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    was how the country became this way. Seventy-five years ago.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    interrupted him, &quot;Seventy-five years ago?&quot; Hugging her
    knees under her pleated skirt, Noriko tilted her head with a puzzled
    look on her face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    then looked over at Shuya. Shuya nodded and then looked back at
    Shogo. &quot;I heard something about how the history they teach us is
    a big lie and that the current Dictator is hardly the 325th Dictator.
    In fact, he's only supposed to be the twelfth one, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    Mimura had told him this. Noriko wouldn't know. It would never be
    taught at school and most adults kept their mouths shut about it
    (maybe they didn't even know), and even Shuya was appalled when he
    first heard it from Shinji. After all, this meant that before the
    appearance of the First Dictator less than eighty years ago—in
    other words, before the Great Revolution—the name of the country
    and system of government had been totally different. (Shinji had
    claimed, &quot;Apparently, it was a feudal society. People wore these
    psychedelic hair styles called chonmage, and there was a caste
    system. But to be blunt, it was better than what we have today&quot;)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    glanced at Noriko's surprised face, but when he heard Shogo's next
    statement, &quot;Well, even that might not be true,&quot; he raised
    his brow.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled and said, &quot;There is no Dictator. He doesn't exist. He's
    just made up. That's what I heard.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    can't be...&quot; Noriko said hoarsely, &quot;but we see him on the
    news...and on New Year's he makes an appearance in front of everyone
    at his palace...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Right.&quot;
    Shogo grinned. &quot;But who is this 'everyone at the palace'? Have
    you ever met someone who was actually there? What if they were actors
    too, just like the Dictator?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    considered the possibility... It made him nauseous. Nothing but lies,
    there was no truth. Everything felt uncertain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Is
    that really true?&quot; he asked despondently.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know. It's just something I heard. But it seems likely to me.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Where
    did you get that information? By computer on that thing called the
    Net?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought of Shinji Mimura when he asked him this, but Shogo only
    grinned again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Unfortunately,
    I'm no good with computers, but there are ways to find out if you
    want to. It seems likely, because that would allow the government to
    have no supreme authority. That way everyone at the center of the
    government would be equal. They would have equal freedom. Which means
    that their responsibilities are also equal. There would be no
    inequality. There'd be no objections. The only thing is&nbsp;that
    there has to be some subtle trick going on. The whole charade has to
    be kept secret from the general public. The leader figure just has to
    play a charismatic role.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took a deep breath and continued, &quot;Anyway, that's neither here
    nor there. To get back to what I was saying, the country implemented
    this system, and it just kept on successfully evolving. What I mean
    by 'success' is that it succeeded as an industrialized nation. Even
    though the country stuck to isolationism, it traded with other
    countries that remained neutral, not only to us but to America as
    well, and imported raw materials from them and sold products to them.
    The products sold well. Of course they would. Their quality is really
    high. Serious competition against the U.S. The only things this
    country lags behind in are space technology and computers. But the
    high quality comes as a result of the individual's subservience to
    the group and an oppressive government. Still...&quot; he stopped.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    shook his head and continued, &quot;I have a feeling that once we've
    reached this level of success even the people themselves are afraid
    of changing the system. With this kind of success, and this high
    standard of living, they won't be willing to make a few sacrifices,
    even if there may be a few little problems. And overthrowing the
    government would be out of the question.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked over at Shuya again and gave him a sarcastic smile. &quot;And
    one of the 'few little problems'? This wonderful game. Of course the
    students and their families might have been dealt a bad hand, but
    they're a small minority. Even the families eventually let it go.
    Sorrow passes with time.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    winding explanation finally returned to this stupid game, the pride
    of the Republic of Greater East Asia. Perhaps it was Shuya's grim
    frown that made Shogo ask, &quot;What's up?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    replied, &quot;I feel like puking.&quot; He finally began to
    understand exactly what Shinji Mimura meant when he said, &quot;This
    is what they call 'successful fascism.' Where else in the world could
    you find something so sinister?&quot; Shinji must have known and
    understood long ago everything Shuya had just learned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ha!
    Wait till you hear this one. It'll make you sick.&quot; Shogo almost
    looked as if he were relishing this as he continued, &quot;I think
    that the fundamental difference between the SKPR and this country is
    ethnic.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ethnic?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded. &quot;Yeah. In other words, I think that this system is
    tailor-made to fit the people of this country. In other words, their
    subservience to superiors. Blind submission. Dependence on others and
    group mentality. Conservatism and passive acceptance. Once they're
    taught something's supposedly a noble cause by serving the public
    good, they can reassure themselves they've done something good, even
    if it means snitching. It's pathetic. There's no room for pride, and
    you can forget about being rational. They can't think for themselves.
    Anything complicated enough sends their heads reeling. Makes me want
    to puke.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was exactly right. It was completely revolting. Shuya felt his
    stomach turn.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when Noriko interrupted Shogo, &quot;I don't agree at all.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Shogo looked at Noriko. The way she was hugging her knees and
    hunched over, Shuya thought she was tired out. But she looked at both
    of them and spoke clearly, &quot;I didn't know about this. This is
    the first time I've ever heard any of this. But if what you just said
    is really true, and if everybody were really informed, I don't think
    they would sit still__It's because no one knows about this that we've
    ended up in this situation. You say we've always been like this, but
    I refuse to believe that. I'm not saying we're especially noble, but
    I think we're just as capable as any other people on this planet of
    dunking responsibly.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    responded with a surprisingly kind and gentle smile. &quot;I like
    what you just said.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    meanwhile all of a sudden saw Noriko in a different light. She didn't
    really stick out in class, nor was she so outspoken she'd express her
    opinions the way she had just done now. It was odd, but ever since
    this game began he was seeing another side of Noriko. And maybe—it
    might only mean Shuya had been totally ignorant—Yoshitoki had
    perceived this side of her long ago.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Anyway
    it was a much more admirable response than his knee-jerk &quot;It
    makes me want to puke.&quot; Once again she was absolutely right. No
    matter what, this was their country, the place where they were born
    and grew up (although he wasn't so sure how much more growing up was
    left for them). The U.S., a.k.a. the American Empire, might liberate
    this country some time in the future, but the fact was that this was
    their deal. They shouldn't, and in the end they couldn't, rely on
    others.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked over at Shogo and asked him, &quot;Hey Shogo. Do you think we
    can change this country?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Much
    to Shuya's disappointment Shogo shook his head. He thought that,
    given his pledge to &quot;tear up this fucked up country,&quot; he
    would reply affirmatively, that they would change it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    said somewhat clumsily, &quot;But you just said you'd tear up this
    country.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    lit a cigarette, which he hadn't done in a while, and then folded his
    arms. &quot;I'll tell you what I think.&quot; He unfolded his arms,
    removed the cigarette from his lips, and exhaled a cloud of smoke. &quot;I
    think history comes in waves.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    didn't understand, but before he could ask what he meant, Shogo
    continued, &quot;At some point in time, when the situation is ripe,
    this country will change. I don't know whether it will happen in the
    form of a war or a revolution. And I have no idea when the time will
    come. For all I know it may never happen.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took another drag and then exhaled. &quot;In any case, right now I
    don't think it's possible. Just like I said, this country is insane,
    but it's also well run. Extremely well run.&quot; Shogo pointed at
    them, the cigarette between his fingers. &quot;Now here we have a
    rotten nation. If you can't stand it, then the wisest thing to do
    would be to abandon it and go somewhere else. There are ways to
    escape this country. Then you can avoid the stench. You might get
    homesick once in a while, but life outside would be grand...but I'm
    not doing that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    rubbed his hand against his thigh. He was hoping Shogo's statement
    would correspond with his thoughts: </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    want to do something here because in the end this is my country.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

    <p class="western" >

    Shogo's response fell short of this expectation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    doing this for myself. I want revenge... even if it's for my

    all. I really doubt it'll actually lead to change in this country in
    the long run.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    they heard the two distant shots, Yutaka cringed. Shinji stopped
    typing on the keyboard.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    nodded. &quot;Another gunshot.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    quickly returned to his computer, though. It seemed harsh, but he
    couldn't afford to be concerned with others.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    looked down at Shinji's fingers. He was holding the Beretta. Shinji
    had handed it to his towel-bandaged hand and requested he keep watch.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    Shinji. What are you trying to find on that laptop? Won't you tell me
    now?&quot; After Shinji had booted up the communications software and
    dialed up with the cellular phone, he kept typing away at that
    keyboard, only occasionally exclaiming &quot;Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!&quot;
    or &quot;Oh damn, oh yeah, right,&quot; without giving Yutaka a
    single explanation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on a sec. I'm almost there.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    was typing again. At the center of the gray screen, English sentences
    interspersed with &quot;%&quot; and &quot;#&quot; characters streamed
    by. Shinji seemed to be responding to them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stopped typing after the requested data began to download. The basic
    operation was UNIX, but he'd set up a separate graphics window to
    indicate the download status in Mac format. Shinji stretched his arms
    over his head. Now he'd just have to wait for the download to be
    completed (of course once it was he'd have to rewrite the log entry
    to erase all traces of his operation). Then he had to come up with a
    strategy based on the data he received. He'd either have to rewrite
    the data or come up with his own program to deceive his opponents.
    The latter would be a hassle, but he probably wouldn't need more than
    half a day to do the job.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji,
    tell me what's going on,&quot; Yutaka insisted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    smiled, moved back from the laptop, and leaned against the tree
    again. He had to admit, this was exciting. He took a deep breath to
    calm himself down. It was only natural, though. Although he wasn't
    sure when he told Yutaka, &quot;It's a PowerBook 150,&quot; now he
    was now certain—they were going to win.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    spoke slowly, &quot;I've been trying to figure out how to escape.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And
    so...&quot; Shinji pointed to his neck. He himself couldn't see it,
    but he assumed Yutaka could see the silver collar wrapped around his
    neck, the same one Yutaka had on his neck. &quot;The first thing I
    wanted was to get rid of this. This is giving our positions away to
    that bastard Sakamochi. For example, the fact that we're together.
    Thanks to this device, even if we try to escape, they'll locate us,
    or worse yet, they can just send a signal to blow up the collars and
    kill us. So I needed to figure out how to get rid of this collar.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    opened up his hand. Then he shrugged. &quot;But I gave up. You can't
    pry it loose without knowing how it's built. Sakamochi said it would
    explode if you took it apart, and I doubt he was bluffing. The outer
    casing must be loaded with a fuse wire for the device. It's probably
    set to ignite once you cut it. It's too dangerous to cross that
    bridge. I thought of inserting a metal plate inside the band, but it
    would be too thin to protect my neck from being blown to bits.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    how I came up with the idea of controlling the school computer that's
    tracking us and controlling the ignition signal. Get it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was of course his uncle who'd taught him the basics of computer
    programming, but ever since his death Shinji was as passionate about
    improving his skills on his uncle's computer as he was about
    basketball. As a result he became extremely adept. He learned how to
    tap into an international line that was strictly prohibited by the
    government and obtain even higher levels of computer skills and new
    information on the entire world through the real internet. (What the
    nation called &quot;the internet&quot; was really a joke—a closed
    net referred to as &quot;Greater East Asia Net.&quot;)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While
    he might not be executed for these actions, they were illegal enough
    to send him away for a two-year stint at a juvenile prison for
    ideological offenses. That was how he acquired the skill to escape
    detection. Of course he never told anyone about it, but he'd shown
    some websites to Yutaka (mostly pornographic ones, come on, gimme a
    break). In short, Shinji was good at computer hacking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    looked for a personal computer. I already had a cell. I guess you're
    allowed to keep your stuff in this stupid game. I should have brought
    my notes, but I can't complain, since I found this laptop. Now all I
    needed was electricity. I yanked that battery out of a car. I had to
    adjust the voltage, but that was pretty easy.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Shinji explained, Yutaka finally began to grasp how the PowerBook and
    cell phone functioned together. But then a thought suddenly occurred
    to him and he said, &quot;Hey, but didn't Sakamochi say we couldn't
    use phones? So cell phones are an exception?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shook his head. &quot;No, they won't work. I tried the number for the
    weather report and Sakamochi's voice chimed in, 'A beautiful day at
    the Shiroiwa Junior High Program Headquarters.' I was so pissed I
    immediately hung up. So they're controlling the nearest cellular
    transmitter. My guess is none of the phone companies will work here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    lifted his finger, interrupting Yutaka. &quot;Think about it. Their
    communication system has to reach beyond this island. I mean, their
    computers must be linked to the central government's for security
    purposes. Then how would they do that? It's simple. They've
    selectively employed numbers for military purposes from the cellular
    phone lines.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    that means—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    interrupted Yutaka again and grinned. &quot;But even if that were the
    case, I thought they must have at least made some minimal effort to
    protect themselves from anyone at the telephone company tampering
    with their lines.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    reached out for the cell phone on the ground. Then he said, &quot;I
    didn't tell you, but my cell is a custom model. It has two types of
    ROM memory for phone numbers and passwords. You can't tell looking at
    it, but you can switch the other one on by turning this screw ninety
    degrees. And this other number is something I came up with just for
    fun to make free calls.&quot; He let go of his phone and
    continued,&nbsp;&quot;It's the cellular number used by phone company
    technicians to test phone lines.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then,
    that means—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    winked. &quot;That's right. Bingo! The rest is simple. It was a bit
    of a pain to hook up the phone modem to the cellular. It's not like
    they came with tools. But I managed to do it. So that's how I got my
    line. Then&nbsp;I accessed my computer at home. I can't hack with
    your average communications software, so I downloaded my special
    tools—like codebreaking software. Then I went for the prefectural
    government's site. The central government's operations must have high
    quality security systems, but I figured the prefectural government's
    systems would be easy to break into. My hunch turned out to be
    right.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Even
    though this game is directly managed by the central government, it
    must have some contact with the government branch of the prefecture
    where the game's taking place. I was right about that too. There were
    a lot of unfamiliar addresses in their communications log files.
    Going through e-mails I found one to the superintendent, notifying
    him of the game's commencement. I broke into the sender's website, in
    other words, the temporary server for the school building on this
    island. It took some work, but as I poked around as much as I could
    without getting caught, I found an operation backup file they'd
    completely spaced out on. So I took that. In other words, I found a
    strange code that seemed important. I've been having the Mac break
    the code before I hooked up with you. So that's what I was up to.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    reached out for the PowerBook as it continued to download data,
    opened up another memo file, and showed the immense 24-point display.
    Yutaka took a look. &quot;Kinpati Sakamocho.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sakamocho?...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.
    I think it's Spanish. So the password was a bit complex due to this
    silly change in vowels. That's what the password for this system is.
    That's how I got free access. I was checking out as much as I could.
    I completely downloaded the entire data contents of the school's
    computer. I'm going to alter the data, go back into that system, and
    disable these collars. By making the school premises a forbidden
    zone, they think they're totally safe against us, but now we'll be
    able to attack them by surprise. We'll have a chance. And once we
    control the school, we should be able to help out the others. Even if
    that's not possible, we can falsify the data to claim we're dead and
    then escape this island for good.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    this brief but intense summary, Shinji took a deep breath and
    grinned. &quot;What do you think?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    looked astonished. &quot;It's amazing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tickled
    by his friends response, Shinji smiled. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Thanks,
    Yutaka. It's always nice to be admired for your talents.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji?&quot;
    Yutaka asked, still looking astonished.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    raised his brow. &quot;What is it? You have a question?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.&quot;
    Yutaka shook his head. &quot;I-I was just wondering.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    looked down and stared down at the Beretta in his hand. Then he
    looked up. &quot;I was wondering why you're friends with someone like
    me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    had no idea what Yutaka was talking about. His mouth hung open. Then
    he asked, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    looked down again. Then he said, &quot;It's just that...I mean you're
    so awesome. I can see how you'd be friends with someone like Shuya.
    Shuya's as athletic as you are, and he's a great guitar player.
    But—I'm nothing. So, I was just wondering why you're friends with
    me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stared at Yutaka, who kept looking down. Then he began to speak,
    &quot;That's ridiculous, Yutaka.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hearing
    Shinji's gentle voice, Yutaka looked up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    continued, &quot;I am who I am. And you're you. Even if I'm pretty
    good at basketball or computers, or popular with the girls, that's
    doesn't make me a better person. You can make people laugh and you're
    kind. When you're serious, you're a lot more sincere than I am. Like
    with girls. I'm not resorting to that cheap cliche about everyone
    having something to offer, but I am saying there are a lot of things
    I admire about you.&quot; He shrugged and then smiled. &quot;I like
    you. We've always been buddies. You're an important friend. My best
    friend.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    saw Yutaka's eyes brimming with tears again. Then, just as before, he
    said, &quot;Damn, thanks, Shinji. Thanks so much.&quot; Then he wiped
    away his tears and laughed, &quot;But if you stick around with a
    crybaby like me you'll end up drowning before we escape.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    started to laugh but then—he heard a ring.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    knit his brows and sat up. It was the Macintosh's standard warning
    sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    knelt in front of the PowerBook and stared at the screen.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    eyes opened wide. A message informed him the line had been
    disconnected and the download aborted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    moaned. He began typing rapidly on the keyboard, but he couldn't save
    the connection. He quit the UNIX communications software and began
    working on dialing up the modem with another communication
    application.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    message appeared, reading, &quot;The number you have dialed is no
    longer in service.&quot; He received the same message no matter how
    many times he tried. The connection between the modem and phone
    appeared to be fine. Just to make sure though, he disconnected the
    phone from the modem and pressed the digits on the phone directly. He
    tried the weather report once again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    cell phone had no signal at all now. Which meant...no, the battery
    was still fully charged.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That
    can't be!</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Holding the cell phone, Shinji gaped at the PowerBook screen, which
    was no longer operating. His hacking was undetectable. That's why it
    was called hacking. And Shinji had the technique.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji?

    the star icon appeared at the edge of the small liquid crystal
    screen, Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No. 11) kept close watch. It
    was the same icon as the one in the center of the screen that had
    been there ever since he'd turned on this handheld device.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was in the residential area on the island's eastern shore. It was
    going to become a forbidden zone soon. He'd been carefully but
    quickly moving between the houses, and finally he saw a change in the
    device. He'd found the device in his day pack. It looked like one of
    those mobile data terminals salarymen use. The change was the first
    response the device gave ever since he turned it on at 6 a.m., after
    he went through the manual. His priority was to sweep the soon-to-be
    forbidden zones, but the device responded in none of those
    areas—sector J-2 on the south shore, sector F-1 in the
    west—and&nbsp;from there he moved here to sector H-8.</font></font></p>

    gripped his stick again with his other hand. (It came off a mop he
    found inside a shack at the north end of the residential area. If he
    wanted to he could have taken a large blade, but this was more useful
    for him, since he'd been studying martial arts ever since he was in
    elementary school.) He proceeded to move diagonally away from the
    wood-sided wall he'd been pressed up against. He had a large frame,
    over 180 cm tall, but he moved dexterously as he pinned himself
    against the wall of the next house. The star icon was approaching the
    similar icon in the center.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    remembered the manual explaining the display system and turned his
    head. It was this house—inside this house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    put the device in his pocket and moved around to the house's
    backyard.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a family garden in the small yard with tomato stalks up to his
    waist, yams planted in the ground, and green onions. Next to them
    pansies and chrysanthemums in different colors were in bloom. In
    front of the garden was a child's tricycle. Its chrome handlebars
    sparkled in the noontime light.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    veranda's storm doors were shut. Opening them might make a big noise.
    Hiroki circled over to the right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a window. It was broken. He was certain now. There was someone
    inside. And if he'd read the radar's manual right then he or she was
    still there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since
    this area would soon be in a forbidden zone, no one should be here
    now. So most likely it was a corpse inside. But he had to know for
    sure.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    slowly lifted his face to the window and looked in. It was a guest
    room with tatami floormats.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    slid the window open. It made no sound. He grabbed the window frame
    and swiftly leaped up like a cat and entered the house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    room had an alcove. At the center was a low table and a large TV in
    the corner by the window on Hiroki's side. There was nothing else.
    Hiroki tiptoed out of the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the hall he smelled something odd, as if he'd caught a whiff of rusty
    metal.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    quickly moved down the hall. The smell became stronger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    came from the kitchen. From inside the shadow of a column, Hiroki
    peeped in.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    saw a pair of white sneakers and a pair of socks on the floor beyond
    the table. He could see the legs up to their calves.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki's
    eyes opened wide. He ran over to the table.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    girl in a sailor suit was lying face down. Her face looked away from
    Hiroki. She was small with short hair, and under her face a puddle of
    blood formed on the floor. There was a lot, but the surface was
    already congealing into a dark red.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was definitely dead. The question was—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Small
    body. Short hair.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    looked like one of the two girls he was looking for. They were both
    equally important to him. She resembled one of them. He couldn't
    remember whether she was wearing sneakers like these, though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    put aside his stick and day pack and knelt down beside the corpse. He
    touched the girl's shoulder with his trembling hand. After a moment's
    hesitation, he clenched his teeth and turned the body over. The shiny
    red blood that hadn't congealed yet gave off a strong odor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a horrible sight. There was a deep gash in her thin throat right
    above the neck band (which was what in fact led him here). The wound
    gaped open like a hole, perhaps due to her blood being completely
    depleted. It resembled an infant's mouth, still without teeth. The
    blood had flowed down from the wound, sullying the silver collar then
    down her chest. Her mouth, nose, and left cheek were all immersed in
    a pool of blood. He deduced, this must have occurred after she fell.
    Drops of blood had formed on the tips of her eyelashes above and
    below her glazed eyes. They had hardened as well.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was Megumi Eto (Female Student No. 3).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    wasn't her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While
    the horrific state of the corpse had shocked him, he was still
    relieved. He closed his eyes for a while and took a deep breath. Then
    he felt guilty for feeling relieved. He gently lifted Megumi's body,
    removed her from the pool of blood, and placed her face up. Rigor
    mortis was setting in, so she felt like a doll. After doing this he
    closed her eyes. After some thought he tried to fold her arms over
    her chest, but her body was too stiff now, so he finally gave up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    grabbed his stick and day pack and stood up. After briefly looking
    over Megumi's body, he headed towards the guest room he had entered.
    It was almost 11 a.m.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Time
    quietly passed. Shogo continued to smoke without uttering a word.
    Noriko kept quiet too. In the thicket little birds chirped away, and
    the branches above them rustled in the breeze, letting in a web of
    light that moved back and forth like a pendulum. You could hear the
    sound of ocean waves if you listened hard enough. Now that they were
    settled in the woods, it almost felt as if they were leading a
    peaceful life.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    partially came from the hope Shuya now had after talking to Shogo.
    They could escape. And if that was what they wanted, they were best
    off lying low and waiting. Despite Noriko's injuries, they were safe
    as long as they kept a close watch. After all, there were three of
    them, and two of them had guns.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shuya couldn't stop thinking about the distant gunshots they heard an
    hour ago.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Had
    someone else been killed? It could have meant—he didn't even want
    to consider it—but it could have been Shinji Mimura or Hiroki
    Sugimura. Even if it was neither of them, it could have been another
    innocent classmate. Shuya and Noriko might be saved thanks to Shogo,
    but the others were living in terror of being killed at any moment.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was enough to disturb Shuya. Yes, yes, he'd already discussed it with
    Shogo. Shogo told him it was best to sit still.&nbsp;He was
    absolutely right. He also said as long as Noriko was injured, they'd
    be prime targets. Again he was right. But, but was it right for them
    to sit back like this? Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano kept their
    faith in the others even though they knew they didn't have a chance
    of escaping. On the other hand, with Shogo's help, he and Noriko had
    a good chance. But did that mean they shouldn't be risking their
    lives?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was clear someone was a murderer—someone was &quot;intentionally
    murdering&quot; others. They'd witnessed Yumiko's and Yukiko's
    deaths. And there might be other murderers. In fact the students he'd
    confronted—Yoshio Akamatsu, Tatsumichi Oki, and Kyoichi
    Motobuchi—might have all been trying to kill him. He doubted anyone
    like that would voluntarily join them. No, someone like that would
    only join them just to betray and kill them when the time was right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But
    shouldn't we at the very least be looking for others we can
    trust?&nbsp;Even if we try though, there's no way to tell them apart
    from the others. If we tried to help everyone, an &quot;enemy&quot;
    would eventually sneak into our group, and that would mean certain
    death. Noriko and Shogo would get killed too.</i></font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    let out a deep sigh. He racked his brains. No matter how many times
    he went over it, he came to the same conclusion. There was nothing
    they could do. He could only hope they'd somehow come across Shinji
    Mimura and Hiroki Sugimura. But what were the chances that would
    happen?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,&quot;
    Shogo said as he lit another cigarette. Shuya looked at him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    thinking too much. It's no use. Just concentrate on yourself and
    Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    lifted his brow. &quot;Are you psychic?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sometimes.
    Especially when the weather's this nice.&quot; Shogo took another
    drag. Then, as if the thought had suddenly occurred to him, he added,
    &quot;Is it true?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    Sakamochi said about you. That you have dangerous ideas.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    that.&quot; Shuya looked down and nodded.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What'd
    you do?&quot; Shogo looked at him mischievously. Shuya returned the
    look.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    were two things he'd done. The first was how he quit the baseball
    team. When he entered junior high school, he joined both the baseball
    team and the music club, but he was turned off by the baseball team's
    military-style discipline and win-at-all-costs attitude. (It wasn't
    surprising. Baseball was the national pastime. It was the sport the
    nation endorsed for international tournaments. Unfortunately,
    baseball was also popular with the American imperialists, so if the
    national team lost to them in the Olympics, the Baseball Federation
    directors would all have to commit harakiri.) On top of that, the
    team's coach, Mr. Minato, would get on the case of players who
    weren't very good, even if they loved the game. So by the second
    week, Shuya was completely fed up and announced he was quitting in a
    four-letter diatribe against Mr. Minato and the Baseball Federation.
    And that was how the golden rookie of Shiroiwa Junior High School
    embarked on a different path towards becoming a different kind of
    star (according to him)—a rock 'n' roll star. At any rate, this
    incident didn't look so good on his school record. But Sakamochi was
    probably referring to the other thing....</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Nothing,&quot;
    Shuya replied. &quot;Sakamochi was probably referring to my listening
    to rock. He was hassling me for being in the music club.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ah,&quot;
    Shogo nodded, wanting to know more. &quot;You play guitar, right? Is
    that how you started listening to rock?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.
    I heard rock, and that was how I started playing guitar. I was at the
    orphanage&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    recalled the middle-aged handyman who worked at the Charity House. He
    was upbeat and his thinning hair was slicked back, sticking up at the
    nape of his neck. (&quot;It's called a duck's tail.&quot;) Now he was
    in a forced labor camp on Sakhalin Island. None of the kids at the
    orphanage, including Shuya and Yoshitoki, knew the details. When he
    said goodbye to them, he didn't offer an explanation and only said,
    &quot;I'll be back, Shuya, Yoshitoki. For a while though, I'll be
    swinging a pickaxe and belting out 'Jailhouse Rock.'&quot; Then he
    gave his old auto-winding wristwatch to Yoshitoki and Gibson electric
    guitar to Shuya. It was Shuya's first guitar. Was he doing all right
    now? He heard that workers at the forced labor camps often died from
    overwork and malnutrition.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Someone
    gave me a tape. He also gave me his electric guitar.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hmm.&quot;
    Shogo nodded. &quot;Who do you like? Dylan? Lennon? Or Lou Reed?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stared back at Shogo. He was taken aback. &quot;I'm impressed.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    wasn't easy getting your hands on rock in the Republic of Greater
    East Asia. Foreign music was strictly monitored by an organization
    called the Popular Music Judiciary Committee, and any kind of music
    that remotely resembled rock would never make it through customs. It
    was treated like an illegal drug. (He'd even seen a poster in the
    prefectural civil office with the same red-circle-and-diagonal-line
    pattern placed over a photo of a sleazy-looking longhaired rocker. It
    read, &quot;Stop Rock.&quot; Great.) Basically, the Republic didn't
    like the music's rhythms, not to mention the lyrics, which might
    agitate the people. Bob Marley was one of them, but an obvious
    example would be Lennon's lines, &quot;You may say I'm a dreamer/But
    I'm not the only one/I hope some day you'll join us and the world
    will be as one.&quot; How could the nation not consider that a
    threat?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    only music you could find at record stores was domestic, mostly trite
    idol pop. The most extreme imported music Shuya came across was
    probably Frank Sinatra. (Although &quot;My Way&quot; might have been
    appropriate song for this country.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    a while Shuya thought the handyman with the duck's tail hairdo was
    sent to the camps for this, so Shuya thought there was something
    scary about the tapes and guitar the man had left behind. Apparently
    he was wrong, though. Once he entered junior high, he found out there
    were plenty of others who were into rock and owned electric guitars.
    (Of course Kazumi Shintani was also a huge rock fan!) It was through
    this group he was able to get dubbed copies of &quot;The Times They
    Are A-Changin'&quot; and &quot;Stand!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    that was only within a close knit group. If there had been a survey
    of the number of students who'd never heard rock, over 90% would have
    said they hadn't. (Even those who had would say they hadn't, so the
    actual result would be 100%.) Given how broad Shogo's knowledge
    seemed to be, it wasn't that strange for him to be exposed to it, but
    Dylan and Lennon were pretty extreme artists.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    look so freaked out,&quot; Shogo said. &quot;I'm a city kid from
    Kobe. I'm not a bumpkin like you guys from Kagawa. I know something
    about rock.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    broke into a slight grin. His guardedness lifted. Then he told Shogo,
    &quot;My favorite's Springsteen. I like Van Morrison too, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;
    'Born to Run' is great. I like Van Morrison's 'Whenever God Shines
    His Light.' &quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    gawked and then broke into a grin. &quot;You know a lot!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grinned back. &quot;I told you. I'm a city kid.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    noticed how Noriko stayed silent. He was worried she might feel
    excluded.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko,
    did you say you've never listened to rock?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    gave him a smile and shook her head. &quot;I've never really heard
    it. What's it like?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    smiled. &quot;The lyrics are really something. I don't know how to
    describe it well, but it's music that really expresses people's
    problems. Of course, songs can be about love, but at times they can
    be about politics or society, or the way we live our lives, and life
    itself. Along with the words, the melody and beat help get the
    message across. Like Springsteen singing, 'Born to Run'...&quot;
    Shuya recked the end of the song, &quot;Together Wendy we can live
    with the sadness/I'll love you with all the madness in my
    soul/Someday girl I don't know when we're gonna get to that place
    where we really want to go/And we'll walk in the sun...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    continued by singing the last line softly, &quot;.</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>..but
    tramps like us, baby we were born to run.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    said to Noriko, &quot;We'll definitely listen to it some time.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    opened her eyes and nodded. Under normal circumstances her face might
    have lit up, but she only responded with a weak smile. Shuya was too
    tired to notice though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    told Shogo, &quot;If everyone listened more to rock then this country
    would come crumbling down.&quot; Just like Noriko said, &quot;It's
    because no one knows about this...&quot; Shuya thought rock music
    revealed everything that was essential. That was why it was banned by
    the government.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    rubbed his stubby Wild Seven cigarette into the ground. He lit
    another. Then he said, &quot;Shuya.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Do
    you really think rock has that kind of power?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded enthusiastically. &quot;Of course it does.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stared at Shuya and looked away. &quot;I don't know. It might just
    serve as an outlet for our frustrations, a convenient way to let off
    steam. It might be banned, but if you really want to listen to rock,
    you can. So it also serves as an outlet. That's what I mean. This
    country is very clever. Who knows, it might end up promoting rock and
    roll as a national resource.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt as if he'd been dealt a blow. Rock was his religion, music
    sheets were the pages of his bible, Springsteen, Van Morrison, and
    his other heroes were the equivalent of the twelve disciples. Of
    course he was getting used to being shocked, what with his classmates
    dying around him, so relatively speaking, it wasn't that shocking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    calmed himself down and slowly replied, &quot;I don't know about
    that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded several times. &quot;I do. In any case, it's not about being
    banned or promoted. That's not what rock's about. Anyone who wants to
    hear it should be able to when they want to. That's what it comes
    down to, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought about this. Then he said, &quot;I never thought about it like
    that. But I see where you're coming from.&quot; Then he added,
    &quot;Incredible. I didn't realize how perceptive you are.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    fell silent for a while.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Shuya said, &quot;But...I still do believe rock is powerful. It's a
    positive force.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Which
    was what Noriko had said about Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    unwrapped a new pack of cigarettes while he looked at Shuya. Shogo
    grinned. He lit the cigarette dangling from his mouth. Then he said,
    &quot;To be honest, I agree with you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    smiled back at him.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    ironic that we're really in that situation though,&quot; Shogo
    observed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&nbsp;Shuya
    was puzzled, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    only thing we can do now is run,&quot; Shogo replied. &quot;We were

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    Minami (Female Student No. 20) got up when she heard the faint
    rustling sound. It came from the grove at the foot of the hill to the
    north, slightly to the east of the island's central region. On the
    map it was designated sector F-8.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    held tightly onto her gun. The gun was a small SIG-Sauer P230 9mm
    Short automatic pistol. It felt large in Kaori's small hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    knowing it, Kaori bit her lip. She'd been hearing the same sound over
    and over once the game began and up until now, while she hid herself
    here. And every time she was relieved to find out it was only caused
    by the wind or some small animal (a stray cat?). But that didn't stop
    her terror. She bit down and cut open her lip, which was now covered
    with cuts that had become scabs. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>This
    time...it might be an enemy. An enemy...that's right.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    One of her classmates would attack her. The images of the corpses of
    Yoshio Akamatsu and Mayumi Tendo vividly came to mind.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    when she'd left the school, she'd heard a voice coming from the woods
    in front of her. It was the voice of the school representative, Yukie
    Utsumi. Then she saw other figures with Yukie in the dark grove.
    Calling out from the dark, Yukie spoke in a hushed but clear voice,
    &quot;Kaori! Come join us! It's just girls! You're safe with us!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But...how
    could she? How could she trust anyone under these circumstances? If
    she stayed with them, she would have had to constantly watch her
    back. Kaori ran away from Utsumi's invitation and in the opposite
    direction...and now she was here. And now...was that the sound of an
    enemy approaching?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    waited for a while, holding the gun with both hands, but the sound
    disappeared.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    waited a little more. The sound was gone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    let out a sigh of relief. She got down on her knees and crouched down
    in the shrubs. The crooked leaves touching her cheeks annoyed her, so
    she changed her position. With the palm of her hands she kept on
    rubbing her face where the leaves had touched her. Her pimples had
    given her enough grief. She didn't want her face to swell up from
    some poison ivy. Even if she was going to die soon, she didn't want
    that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    felt a chill run down her spine. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Die?
    Am I going to do die? Am I really going to die?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    thought alone was enough to make her heart beat faster. She felt like
    she was going to have a seizure.</font></font></p>

    Like a crummy CD player unable to ignore a scratch on the disc the

    I going to die?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    snatched desperately at the brass locket she wore around her neck
    underneath her uniform. It popped open, and a bright, cheerful face
    with long hair smiled at Kaori.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she concentrated on it, Kaori's pulse finally managed to slow down
    and return to its normal pace.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a photo of Junya Kenzaki of the pop group Flip Side. He was the
    most popular member with girls. This special locket was only
    available to fan club members. Kaori was proud to know she was the
    only student in her school who had one. (Of course most girls
    nowadays could care less. Besides, lockets were passé. But Kaori
    didn't think so.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh...Junya.

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    thought Junya Kenzaki was telling her, &quot;It's all right. Of
    course you're all right. Shall I sing your favorite song, 'Galaxy
    Magnum'?&quot; Kaori's breathing calmed down a bit. Then she asked
    the photo:</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Say,
    Junya. Should I have joined Yukie? I wonder if that would have saved
    me? No, that can't be.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    tear came rolling down Kaori's cheeks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	How
    could this be happening? She wanted to see her mom. She wanted to see
    her dad. She wanted to see her sister and her kind grandma and
    grandpa. She wanted to take a bath, rub cream on her pimples, sit on
    the comfortable couch in the living room, and sip on a cup of cocoa
    while she watched a video of Flip Side's TV show. (Although she'd
    seen this episode many, many times already.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Junya,
    help me. Please...I feel like I'm going crazy.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    moment she actually heard her voice say this out loud, Kaori felt as
    if she were really going insane. It freaked her out. Nausea welled up
    to her chest. She was crying frantically now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    suddenly heard a rustling sound behind her, and her body flinched. It
    was much louder than the previous sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    eyes bleary with tears, she turned around.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    boy was looking at her through the shrubs. It was Hiroki Sugimura
    (Male Student No. 11). He'd snuck up behind her!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    was completely terrified and too numb to think as she lifted the gun
    and pulled the trigger. Her wrists jerked back with the popping
    sound. A gold shell flew out, and the sun's rays reflected off it as
    it&nbsp;shone through the branches. Hiroki had already disappeared
    deep inside the thicket. The rustling continued and also disappeared.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    was trembling. She was still holding the gun. Then she snatched her
    belongings and ran in the opposite direction. As she ran, her
    agitated mind raced with thoughts. She was sure Hiroki Sugimura was
    trying to kill her. Why else would he have snuck up behind her
    without saying anything? Hiroki Sugimura probably didn't have a gun.
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He
    saw that I did and ran away in a panic. If I hadn't noticed him—and
    shot at him—then Hiroki Sugimura would probably have stabbed my
    chest with a knife or something. A knife! I have to be careful. I
    have to shoot anyone I come across. No mercy. Otherwise, I'll end up
    getting killed...killed!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh

    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	J-5
    was the southeast shore of the island. H-3 was near the top of the
    southern mountain. D-8 was the hilly area on the southeast side of
    the northern mountain peak. Their zone, C-3, wasn't announced. That
    meant they wouldn't have to move.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With

    came to an end.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    sighed. He put away the map and examined the student list, which was
    now ridden with check marks. &quot;We're down to twenty-five
    students. Damn.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    cupped his hand as he lit another cigarette. Then he said, &quot;It's
    like I said. The numbers are steadily dwindling.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked up at Shogo. He got Shogo's point. The more classmates that
    died the closer they were to escaping. But...&quot;That was uncalled
    for.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    only shrugged. He shifted his eyes and then said, &quot;Hey, I'm
    sorry.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wanted to say more, but he tore his eyes away from Shogo's face. He
    pulled in his knees and stared down between them. There were several
    tiny yellow flowers poking out from the grass, and an ant was
    crawling up one of the stems.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    was the issue. Shuya had felt like they'd become buddies when they
    talked about rock, but in the end there was still something about
    Shogo that bothered him. Was it simply that there was a cold side to
    Shogo?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    took in a small breath and then thought of something else. Of the six
    deaths Sakamochi had announced, Yoji Kuramoto and Yoshimi Yahagi were
    the only ones Shuya didn't witness. He was pretty sure they were
    going out. Did that mean they were together? And the two gunshots
    they heard after 10 p.m...was that them? If so, who could have...&nbsp;He
    remembered the sound of the machine gun slaughtering Yukiko Kitano
    and Yumiko Kusaka. Did the same person kill them too? Or...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya,&quot;
    Shogo said. He looked up. &quot;You haven't had breakfast, right?
    This government-supplied bread sucks, but I found some coffee and
    strawberry jam at the supply store. Let's eat.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took out a jar and a slim can (200g) of canned coffee. The jar's
    label was illustrated with strawberries, and he could see the shiny,
    thick, red contents inside the glass. Shuya assumed Shogo was going
    to toss the coffee into a pot of boiling water on the fire. Shogo
    also pulled out a bag of plastic cups.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    loaded up.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yep,&quot;
    Shogo nodded. Then he proceeded to pull out a long, thin box. &quot;Look
    at this. An entire carton of Wild Sevens.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    decided to cheer up. He smiled, nodding. He took out the bread in his
    day pack and offered one to Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko,
    we should eat.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked up, still hugging her knees. &quot;I'm...all right. I'm not
    hungry.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    wrong? Is your appetite...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized as she looked down again how pale her face had become. He'd
    suddenly realized how quiet she'd been.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    approached her. Shogo observed them as he opened the lid of the
    coffee can.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    touched her on the shoulder. Noriko clenched her hands together. Her
    lips were tightly shut, forming a straight line across her pale face.
    Only now did Shuya finally realize that air was painfully hissing
    through her lips. She was having difficulty breathing. She closed her
    eyes, released her hands, put them on his arm, and leaned against
    him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    body temperature, which he sensed from her hands and through the
    shoulder area of the sailor suit, felt abnormally high, as if she
    were nursing a chick underneath her clothes. Shuya brushed off the
    hair on her forehead and felt her forehead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was incredibly hot. The cold sweat on her forehead drenched the palm
    of his hand.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Panicking,
    he turned to Shogo. &quot;She's got a fever! Shogo!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm...fine,&quot;
    Noriko said weakly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    put down the can of coffee and got up. He exchanged positions with
    Shuya and touched her forehead. He rubbed his chin and then held her
    wrist. He seemed to be taking her pulse as he checked his wristwatch.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    sorry about this,&quot; he said as he put the fingers of his right
    hand to her lips and had her open her mouth. Then he pressed the skin
    under her eyes downward and looked under her lower eyelids.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    must feel cold.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Narrowing
    her eyes, Noriko nodded, &quot;Yeah...a little...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    is she?&quot; Shuya asked nervously. He'd been holding his breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Just
    give me your coat,&quot; Shogo said as he removed his own school
    coat. Shuya quickly removed his too and gave it to Shogo. Shogo
    carefully wrapped the two coats around Noriko's body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Bread.
    I need the jam and water too,&quot; Shogo instructed, and Shuya
    swiftly snatched the bread and water he'd offered to Noriko as well
    as the jam left on top of Shogo's day pack. Shogo hastily dipped the
    bread into the jar, covering it with red jam. He offered it to
    Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    have to eat this, Noriko.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know...but...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Just
    eat it. Even a little will help,&quot; Shogo's insisted. Noriko
    hesitantly took the bread and nibbled on the bread a couple times.
    She made an effort to swallow it. Then she returned the rest of the
    bread to Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No
    more, huh?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    barely shook her head. Even shaking her head seemed to exhaust her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    wanted her to eat more, but then he set the bread aside and once
    again pulled out the small pouch of medicine from his pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    cold medicine,&quot; he said and gave her a capsule that was
    different from the pain reliever he'd given her before. Noriko
    nodded. With Shogo's help she managed to swallow it down with water
    from the bottle. Water came streaming from her mouth, but Shogo
    gently wiped it away.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay,
    now lie down.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded obediently and lay down on the grass, still wrapped up in the
    two coats.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    going on, Shogo? Is she gonna be right?&quot; Shuya asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head. &quot;I don't know for sure yet. It may just be a
    fever. But she might be infected from the wound.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    Noriko lying down, Shuya looked down at the bandanna bandage wrapped
    around her right calf.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But...I
    thought we cleaned out her wound.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head again. &quot;She moved around the woods a lot after
    she was shot, right? She might have been infected before we treated
    her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stared at Shogo for a while and then knelt down beside Noriko. He
    reached his hand out to Noriko's forehead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    opened her eyes. She smiled feebly.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    all right...I'm just a little tired. Don't worry.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    her breathing hardly indicated she was all right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked over at Shogo again. He restrained himself from sounding
    overly agitated and said, &quot;Shogo. We can't stay here. We have to
    move. We should at least find a house where she can get warm—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    cut him off, &quot;Just hold on. Let's just wait and see for now.&quot;
    He tightly wrapped the makeshift blanket-coats around Noriko's body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    too dangerous for us to move. I told you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    faintly opened her eyes. She looked over at Shuya and said, &quot;I'm
    so sorry...Shuya...&quot; Then she said to Shogo, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot;
    and closed her eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    lips tightened as he looked down at Noriko's pale face.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    Chigusa (Female Student No. 13) stuck her head out from under the
    shadow of a tree trunk. She was halfway up the eastern side of the
    island's southern mountain. According to the map she was somewhere
    near the border between H-4 and H-5. There was a grove full of trees
    that grew shorter as she headed up the mountain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    gripped her weapon, an ice pick, and looked back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    house she'd been hiding inside was obscured by trees and no longer
    visible. It was decrepit and overrun by tall grass and seemed like
    it'd been abandoned even before the island had been evacuated. She
    remembered something like a chicken shack was connected to the main
    building. Now she couldn't even see the rusty tin roof. How far had
    she come? Two hundred meters? One hundred meters? Takako was the
    girls' track team's best short-distance sprinter (she held the
    prefect's all-time second-place junior-high record for the
    200-meter), so she had a good sense of running distances, but she
    wasn't sure now, mainly because of the hills and bushes, not to
    mention the tension she was feeling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    eating awful bread and water for breakfast, Takako decided to wait
    until 1 p.m. to leave the house. She'd been hearing what sounded like
    gunshots ever since the game started and hid in a corner of the
    abandoned house, but now she thought staying cooped up like that
    wouldn't do any good. She had to join up with someone—at least a
    friend she could trust—and proceed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course it was possible friends she trusted wouldn't trust her. But...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    was a beautiful girl. Her upward-curving eyes were a little
    fierce-looking, but they matched with her sharp chin, well formed
    mouth, and nicely defined nose, all of which gave her an
    &quot;aristocratic&quot; look. Her long hair was dyed with orange
    streaks, which might look odd at first, but with her jewelry—which
    included earrings, two in her left ear, one in her right, designer
    rings on the middle and ring fingers of her left hand, a total of
    five bracelets on her wrists, and a pendant made from a foreign
    coin—she managed to assert her own look that made her all the more
    attractive. Her teachers didn't really approve of her hair and gaudy
    jewelry, but she got good grades and because she was the track team's
    star sprinter, she never got directly criticized. Basically Takako
    was very proud. She wasn't going to be bound by the silly school
    rules that the other girls followed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whether
    it was—unfortunately enough—because of her beauty, or her pride,
    or whether it was because she was simply shy, Takako didn't have many
    close friends in her class. Her best friend was Kahoru Kitazawa, whom
    she'd known ever since elementary school, but she was in another
    class.&nbsp;But there was someone in her class whom Takako could
    trust. The student wasn't a girl, though. She'd known him since they
    were kids.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    with him in mind, she couldn't help being preoccupied by something.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    she left the school building Takako thought someone who'd left before
    her might come back. In that case, she'd have to leave with extreme
    caution. And it was best to leave the school by foiling the
    assailant's expectations.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    she came into the hall, she peeked outside through the exit door.
    There were woods in front of her, and a hill on the left. The area to
    her right was relatively open. The assailant, if there was one, would
    have to be hiding in the woods or in the hill.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    stayed down as she left the building and dashed to her right, staying
    close to the school building wall. The track star let her mighty legs
    cut loose. She didn't even have to think about it. She ran down the
    street through a cluster of houses and into a narrow alley. Then she
    ran toward the base of the southern mountain. All her energy was
    focused on getting away from the school and finding somewhere to
    hide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What
    if there had been someone in the woods or in the hill in front of the
    school who had no intention of attacking her? In other words what if
    he who'd left before her, had hid in the woods or the&nbsp;mountain,
    had been waiting for her? Maybe she'd lost her chance by running out
    of there at full speed?&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    didn't think so. What else could she have done? Anyone hanging around
    the school was jeopardizing his or her life. They had known each
    other since they were kids— it was nothing more than that. They had
    remained decent friends through all these years. She thought it was
    presumptuous of her to think that he—Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student
    No. 11)—would risk his life waiting for her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    important thing was finding someone now. Finding Hiroki Sugimura
    would be ideal, but she knew that was too optimistic. She'd settle
    for the school representative Yukie Utsumi or some average girl. As
    long as she was careful not to get shot, she could calm them down. If
    they were calm already, that would be even better (although the
    thought of someone calm under these circumstances was a bit scary
    too). To find that someone, that was all she could do for now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    one thing she knew not to do was to raise her voice. She had proof of
    that, now. From the abandoned house Takako had also seen Yumiko
    Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano die on top of the northern mountain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    Takako decided to leave the abandoned shack where she was hiding and
    climb up to the peak of the southern mountain. Once she was there,
    she'd descend the slope by circling the mountain, checking for anyone
    hiding in the bushes. She could throw pebbles at the bushes just as
    she'd been doing ever since she left the shack. Once she figured out
    who it was she could decide whether or not to approach that person.
    At noon Sakamochi had announced that the area around the peak of the
    southern mountain would become a forbidden zone at 3 p.m., but as
    long as she didn't run into any problems she'd be able to completely
    survey the area before then. Also, if there was anyone in the area
    then he or she would have to be out of there by 3 p.m. She'd have a
    better chance locating someone on the move.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    checked her supplied wristwatch. It was 1:20 p.m. She usually wore
    bracelets so she never wore a watch, but she couldn't afford that
    luxury now. Then she touched her collar.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>If
    you try to pry it loose it will explode.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was suffocating—not only the way it dug into her neck, but its mere
    presence. The chain of her pendant lightly tapped against the band.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    decided to ignore it and gripped her ice pick (what good was this
    weapon though?) with her left hand. With her right she grabbed some
    pebbles and tossed them out in front of her to her left and
    right.&nbsp;They made a rustling sound in the grove.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    waited for a while. No response. She moved forward. She took a deep
    breath, ready to run up the open ground between the bushes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    she heard a rustling sound. Someone's head popped out of the bushes,
    approximately ten meters to her left. She could see the back of his
    coat and the back of his head. Its hair was slightly disheveled but
    still smooth. His head turned left and right checking the area.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    froze. She was in trouble. It was a guy. Guys were trouble. She had
    no particular reason to think so, but she had a hunch anyone besides
    Hiroki Sugimura was trouble. And she could immediately tell this guy
    was not him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    held her breath and slowly stepped back into the thicket behind her.
    She knew this would happen, but that didn't stop her from trembling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    the boy turned around. Their eyes met. The face, which had an
    expression of utter astonishment, belonged to Kazushi Niida (Male
    Student No. 16).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    man, why did I have to bump into this jerk?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    What mattered now was that she was totally exposed and how dangerous
    that was. She turned around and started running back the way she
    came.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wait!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    heard Kazushi's voice. The sound of him waded through the thicket,
    coming after her.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wait!&quot;
    Now he was shouting. &quot;Wait!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Ugh!

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    hesitated for a few moments and then stopped. She looked back. If
    Kazushi had a gun and wanted to shoot her he'd have done that by now.
    More troubling was his shouting. It endangered not only his life but
    hers. Just as it was moments ago there didn't seem to be anyone in
    the area.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Slowing
    down, Kazushi descended the slope.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    realized Kazushi held a rifle loaded with an arrow in his right hand.
    It wasn't pointed at Takako right now—but if it was, could she
    dodge it and run away? Should she have stopped?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No.
    Takako reassured herself, she'd done the right thing. Kazushi Niida
    was a forward on the soccer team. Top athletes like him were as fast
    if not faster than track runners. Even though Takako was a star track
    runner, he'd have eventually caught up with her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Either
    way it was too late.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    stopped several meters away from her. He had wide shoulders and was
    relatively tall and well built. His smooth hair was long, which was
    the current fashion with soccer players, but now it was disheveled,
    as if he'd been playing in a close match that had gone into overtime.
    A smile emerged on his face, which was pretty good looking except for
    his bad teeth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What
    does he want?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Takako thought as he observed his face.&nbsp;</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He
    might not have any harmful intentions. He might actually be thinking
    he finally found someone he could trust.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Takako didn't have a very good impression of Kazushi Niida. To put it
    bluntly, she couldn't stand his kind of chumminess. She also couldn't
    stand his arrogance. They'd been classmates ever since their first
    year in junior high. (Hiroki became her classmate in second-year.)
    Without putting much effort into them, Kazushi was above average in
    grades and sports, but in spite of that—or maybe it had nothing to
    do with that—his immaturity really stuck out. He tried to impress
    others, and when he'd screw up he'd come up with some lame-ass
    excuse. Furthermore, and this was really stupid, but when they were
    first-year students, there were rumors that she and Kazushi were
    going out. (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Junior
    high kids don't have anything better to do. Well, let them say what
    they want.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)
    Every time the rumors got going again he'd go to her desk and touch
    her on the shoulder (how dare he) and tell her, &quot;There's a rumor
    floating around about us.&quot; Takako would turn away and brush his
    hand off with the reply, &quot;Oh, I'm so honored.&quot; She let it
    slide, scoffing at him on the inside (&quot;Go away you little brat.
    You've got some nerve&quot;), but now she wasn't in the position to
    do the same thing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    spoke cautiously. She had to get away from him as quickly as
    possible. That's what it came down to.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    shout, you idiot!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    sorry,&quot; Kazushi answered. &quot;But you were the one who took
    off.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    didn't mess around with her response. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Get
    to the point, cut to the chase</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Her best features. &quot;The fact is, I don't want to be with you.&quot;
    She looked at Kazushi and managed to shrug her tense shoulders.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi's
    grimaced. &quot;Why?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Because
    you act like you're such a goody-goody,</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    she thought.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Look,
    we both know why. Okay, later,&quot; Takako said as she got ready to
    run. Still, she felt herself hesitating as her feet trembled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    stopped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because
    out of the corner of her eye she saw the weapon in Kazushi's right
    hand pointed at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    slowly turned around, keeping a close eye on his fingers on the
    trigger of his bow gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    this?&quot; she asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    casually slid the day pack off her left shoulder and caught its
    strap. Would it be able to shield her from the force of the bow gun?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't want to resort to this,&quot; Kazushi said. This was exactly
    what she couldn't stand about him. He was making excuses, but in fact
    he was trying to gain the upper hand. &quot;So you better stay with
    me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    pissed her off. But that was also when she noticed something. When
    she was hiding in the shack her uniform skirt got caught on a broken
    door. The tear resembled the slit up a Chinese dress, and now Kazushi
    was looking down at it. His eyes were strangely glazed over. It gave
    her the creeps.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    quickly moved her legs to cover them as much as possible. Then she
    said, &quot;Give me a break. You expect me to join you with that
    stuck in my face?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you promise not to run away?&quot; Kazushi spoke in his usual
    arrogant voice. He didn't lower the bow gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    had to put up with him. &quot;Just put that down.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you won't run?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you deaf?&quot; Takako said sharply, and Kazushi reluctantly lowered
    his weapon.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he assumed a smug tone as he said, &quot;I've always thought you were
    fine.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    raised her well defined, elegantly arched eyebrows.&nbsp;</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>After
    threatening her life like this, he has the nerve to say I'm fine!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi's
    eyes fell on her legs again. He made no effort to be subtle, and his
    eyes were locked onto them now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    lifted her chin slightly. &quot;So?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    I won't kill you. Just stay with me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    shrugged again. Any hesitation she might have had was now wiped out
    by anger. &quot;I told you I don't want to,&quot; she spat out.
    &quot;Later.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    turned to...no, this time she began moving backwards and staring back
    at Kazushi. Kazushi lifted his bow gun again. His face had the
    expression of a kid begging for a toy at a department store. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Mom,
    I want it, I want it!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    quietly said, &quot;Stop this.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then...stay
    with me,&quot; Kazushi repeated. The way he tilted his head revealed
    how frantic he was trying to calm his nerves.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    repeated, &quot;I told you, no.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    didn't lower the gun. They glared at each other.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    couldn't bear it anymore. &quot;You know...what do you want? Say it.
    You're not killing me off. I tell you, I don't want to be with you,
    but you insist. I don't get it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I...&quot;
    Kazushi stared at Takako with that leer in his eyes and said, &quot;I'm
    saying I'll protect you. So just stay with me. We're safer together,
    right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You've
    gotta be joking. You have the nerve to threaten me like that and say
    you'll protect me? I can't trust you. Get it? Can I go now? I'm
    going.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    replied, &quot;If you move I'll shoot you.&quot; He aimed the bow gun
    directly at her chest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    openly threatening her like this Kazushi lost any chance he had of
    keeping to a civilized code of conduct (not that he had much of sense
    of that to begin with). He stood still and said, &quot;You better
    obey me, girl. A woman obeys his man.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    was furious. Then he had the nerve to say, &quot;You're a virgin,
    aren't you?&quot; in a casual tone, as if he were only confirming her
    blood type (B).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    was at a loss for words.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What
    did this asshole say?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Am
    I wrong? Hiroki wouldn't have the guts to sleep with a girl.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    said this because probably he, along with many of her other
    classmates, had the mistaken assumption that she was going out with
    Hiroki Sugimura. She had two reasons to be especially annoyed,
    though. First of all, her relationship with Hiroki was none of their
    business. Second, Kazushi's making fun of Hiroki pissed her
    off.&nbsp;Takako broke into a grin. She'd realized a long time ago
    how she could always grin when she was absolutely furious.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    she grinned like this at Kazushi and said, &quot;What's it got to do
    with you?&quot; Kazushi might have misinterpreted Takako's grin.
    Kazushi grinned back. &quot;So I'm right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    smiling, Takako glared back at him. Y</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>es,
    in fact you are right. I might look a little flashy, but just as you
    said, I'm a virgin. An innocent 15-year-old girl. However...</i></font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>It's

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    continued, &quot;We're gonna die anyway. Don't you want to try it
    once before you die? I'd be a good partner.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    Takako had never felt so angry in her life, she couldn't help but
    gawk back at him in amazement. Her mouth might have even hung open.
    His exasperating, outrageous behavior was bad enough, but now it was
    so out of control it was like he was from another world. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Captain
    Columbus, that is San Salvador Island. Okay, they're barbarians.
    Beware of the barbarians.&nbsp;Takako looked down—and burst out in
    laughter. It was incredibly funny. This sitcom would have been a hit.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    lifted her face. She must have been glaring at Kazushi, but she'd
    still give him one last chance.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    is my last offer. I don't want to be with you. Just put that down and
    leave me alone. Otherwise, I'll take it that you're going to kill me.
    All right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    didn't move his bow gun. Instead he raised it up to his shoulders and
    threatened her, &quot;This is my last warning. You better obey me,
    Takako.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    fact that Takako felt a thrill at this exchange, which was in some
    ways the turning point of their encounter, may have been indicative
    of her personality. And from here on...she couldn't be held
    responsible for what would happen.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    took a step forward to put an end to this conversation with this
    asshole.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see. So you just want to rape me. Right? You think dying gives you
    the right to do anything?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    glared back at her. &quot;That's not what I said...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What's
    the difference?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    She laughed at him inside. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Let
    me guess what you'll say next. I don't want to rape you, but you
    better take off your clothes?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    continued grinning as she calmly tilted her head. She said, &quot;Right
    now, you might want to worry more about your life than about your
    lame-ass dick.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi's
    face suddenly flushed. His mouth twisted as he spouted off, &quot;Shut
    up! You really want to get raped?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    grinned and answered, &quot;So the truth comes out.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    told you to shut up!&quot; Kazushi repeated. &quot;I can kill you if
    I want, you know!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    made her sick. She remembered how he tried to coax her into it just
    moments ago, saying, &quot;I won't kill you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    paused and then boasted, &quot;I already killed Yoshio.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    was a little shocked, but she merely lifted her brow and remarked,
    &quot;Huh.&quot; Even if it were true...given how he'd been hiding,
    he'd probably been terrified, then somehow bumped into Yoshio
    Akamatsu and ended up killing him by accident. After that, too scared
    of anyone stronger than him, he probably spent this whole time
    hiding. But knowing him, she knew that if he ended up surviving by
    hiding until he had one weaker final opponent, he'd say something
    like, &quot;I have no choice&quot; and kill him or her without
    hesitation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    was thinking,&quot; Kazushi continued, confirming Takako's suspicion.
    &quot;I decided this is a game. So I'm not going to pull any
    punches.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    looked shocked, but then his face became sulky again. His cold eyes
    shone. &quot;You want to die?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    hesitated. It was her chance. Takako threw the pebbles she'd
    cautiously taken out of her pocket at his face. As Kazushi covered
    his face to shield himself, she quickly turned around, dropped the
    day pack, and dashed back the way she came, all the while holding
    onto the ice pick.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    thought she could hear him curse behind her. With a good runner's
    sprint she'd coveted fifteen meters when suddenly she felt a blow
    against her right leg and fell face forward. Her cheek got cut as it
    scraped against a tree root poking out of the ground. She was more
    upset over this wound on her face than she was over the sharp pain in
    her leg. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That
    asshole cut my face!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    twisted her body around. A silver arrow pierced her skirt and was
    planted in the back of her right thigh. Blood dripped down her well
    toned leg muscles.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    caught up with her. Seeing her sitting there, he tossed aside the bow
    gun and took out a pair of short sticks chained
    together—nunchaku—from under his belt and held them in his right
    hand. The chain rattled (this weapon, by the way, had been in Mayumi
    Tendo's day pack, which Kazushi then took after killing Yoshio
    Akamatsu). (His own weapon for some bizarre reason was a plain
    shamisen banjo that was completely useless. Of course, this had
    nothing to do with Takako.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    glanced at the bow gun on the ground and thought, y</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ou'll
    regret you put that down</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    your fault,&quot; Kazushi said, panting. &quot;You provoked me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    seated, Takako glared up at Kazushi. The bastard was still making
    excuses. She couldn't believe she'd actually been classmates with
    this idiot for over two years.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wait,&quot;
    Takako said. As Kazushi knit his brows she got on her knees and
    twisted her right shoulder around, pulling out the arrow in one swift
    motion as she clenched her teeth. She could feel the flesh tear,
    followed by a gush of blood. Her skirt was torn again. So now her
    skirt had two slits.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    tossed the arrow aside and stood up, glaring at Kazushi. She was all
    right. The pain was incredible but she could take it. She shifted the
    ice pick over to her right hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    do it,&quot; Kazushi said. &quot;It's no use.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    tilted the ice pick sideways, pointing it at his chest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    said this was a game, right? Fine. I'll be your opponent. I won't
    lose against an asshole like you. I'll give everything I have to
    erase your existence. Got it? Do you understand? Or are you too
    stupid?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Kazushi still seemed at ease. He was probably thinking how she was a
    girl, and what's more, injured, so he couldn't lose against her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    say it again,&quot; she continued, &quot;Don't even think of raping
    me after beating me to a pulp. Look, little kid, you should worry
    more about your life than your dick.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi's
    face contorted, and he raised the nunchucks up to his face.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    gripped her ice pick. The tension between them mounted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was probably fifteen centimeters taller, twenty kilograms heavier.
    Takako was probably the number one female athlete in her class but
    she had little chance of winning. On top of this, her right leg was
    pretty badly injured. But she couldn't lose, no matter what.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    Kazushi made a move. He came forward, swinging the nunchucks down!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    blocked them with her right arm. One of her two bracelets flew into
    the air (it was made by South American Indians, it was a favorite,
    damn). She felt a sting run up her arm up to the center of her skull.
    Despite the sting though, she thrust the ice pick upward. Kazushi
    grimaced as he stepped back, dodging it. Once again they were two
    meters apart.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako's
    left arm was stinging now. But she was all right, nothing was
    broken.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    resumed his attack. This time he swung the nunchucks with the motion
    of a backhand tennis swing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    dodged them by crouching down. The nunchucks skimmed her long,
    streaked hair—several strands flew into the air. Takako quickly
    swung her ice pick at his right wrist. She felt it wound him slightly
    as Kazushi groaned a little and stepped back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were apart again. Kazushi's wrist, the hand holding the nunchucks,
    was red. But the cut didn't seem severe.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    wound on her right leg was throbbing. She could tell the entire leg
    below her thigh was covered with blood. She wouldn't last much longer
    like this. She also noticed a panting sound. It came from her lips.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    once again swung his nunchucks. She could see he was aiming at the
    left side of her head and her shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    stepped forward. She suddenly recalled something Hiroki, who was a
    martial arts expert, had taught her, &quot;You can defeat your
    opponent by throwing his timing off. Sometimes, taking a bold step
    forward can be crucial.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    nunchucks hit her shoulder, but just as Hiroki had said, it was only
    the chain, which hardly hurt her. Takako leaped into his chest.
    Kazushi's face, his eyes wide open in dismay, was right in front of
    hers. She thrust the ice pick upward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    shoved Takako away with his empty left hand. Takako lost her balance
    from her wounded right leg and fell forward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Barely
    escaping her stab, Kazushi rubbed his unharmed chest with his left
    hand. &quot;You're really something,&quot; he said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    quickly swung his nunchucks down at Takako, who was slow getting up.
    This time he was aiming at her face!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    blocked the blow with her ice pick. Along with the metallic clang,
    the ice pick flew into the air and landed in the dirt. The only thing
    left in her hand now was intense pain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    bit her lip. She glared at him as she stepped back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    grinned and slowly came forward. Undoubtedly this guy was mentally
    disturbed. He had no qualms about beating a girl to death. In fact,
    he was enjoying it!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    swung his nunchucks again. She dodged them by bending back—but the
    nunchucks followed her instead. Perhaps he'd gotten used to them.
    This time Kazushi managed to extend his reach.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    felt a sharp thud against the left side of her head. She began to
    sway. A warm liquid came flowing out her left nostril.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was on the verge of falling. Kazushi must have looked like he was
    sure he'd won.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    swaying, Takako's pretty, sharply curved eyes squinted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she fell, she stretched out her long legs and with all her might
    kicked Kazushi's left knee from the right side. Kazushi let out a
    painful moan and fell on his left knee. His body floundered and
    rotated halfway on his knee. Now she saw his back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Had
    she tried to take the ice pick, Takako might have lost. But that
    wasn't what she did.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    leaped onto Kazushi's back.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    clutched onto his head as if riding on his shoulders. Her weight
    forced him to fall forward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If
    a thought occurred to her it was in choosing which fingers she should
    use. Her index and middle. No! The strongest combination would be her
    middle finger and thumb. And Takako had always taken good care of her
    nails. No matter how many times her team coach Mr. Tada scolded her
    about them she refused to shorten her nails.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hanging
    onto Kazushi, Takako grabbed hold of his hair and yanked his head
    back. She could tell where they were.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    must have suddenly realized her intentions. She saw him shut his
    eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was useless though. Takako's right middle finger and thumb tore
    through his eyelids and dug into his eye sockets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;AIEEEEEEEEEEE!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    screamed. He fell on his arms, got up on his knees, dropped his
    nunchucks, and tried to brush off her hands. His body moved
    frantically as he tried to get rid of her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    held tightly onto Kazushi and refused to let go. She pushed her
    fingers in further. Her thumb and middle finger dug in up to their
    second joints. As she dug in, she felt something pop and realized it
    was his eyeballs. She didn't expect eye sockets to be this small.
    Takako didn't hesitate to bend her sharp fingers inward. Blood and a
    semi-transparent slimy liquid came oozing down his cheeks like weird
    tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;ARRRRGH,&quot;
    Kazushi cried as he got up and swung his arms around frantically. He
    tried to pry her right hand loose from his head with both of his
    hands and pulled at Takako's hair.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    leaped off Kazushi, who ended up with what felt like several strands
    or even a bundle of hair.&nbsp;Well, she couldn't be worried about
    that now.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    looked for her ice pick and found it. She snatched it up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazushi
    moaned and swung his arms at the (literally) unseen enemy. Then he
    fell back on his rear end. His eyes were open, but his eyes were
    completely immersed in a sea of red. He resembled an albino monkey
    now. Takako dragged her right leg and limped toward him. She lifted
    her wounded right leg and stomped down onto his unprotected crotch.
    The purple-striped white track sneaker was now red, soaked with
    Takako's own blood. Underneath its sole she felt a squashing
    sensation as if she were crushing a rodent. &quot;URGH,&quot; Kazushi
    moaned. He held his crotch and turned on his side, balled up like a
    fetus. Now Takako began stepping on his throat with her left leg. She
    put her weight on it. Kazushi reached out, trying to move her foot,
    hitting it feebly, trying to free himself.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hel—&quot;
    Kazushi uttered. It sounded like a tiny draft of air because his
    throat had been crushed.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Help...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Yeah
    right</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Takako thought. She could tell her mouth was breaking into a grin.
    She realized she wasn't angry anymore. She was actually enjoying
    this. She was sure about it. So what? She never claimed to be Pope
    John Paul II or the 14th Dalai Lama.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    her knees now, she thrust the ice pick into his mouth (she saw
    several cavity fillings). His arms which were struggling to pull at
    her leg suddenly froze. Takako pushed further. It sunk into his
    throat without much resistance. Kazushi's entire body, from his chest
    down to his toes, then went into convulsions as if swimming the
    submariner. Then it stopped. The albino eyes still remained open,
    surrounded by a spider's web pattern of gooey blood like running
    paint.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    felt a sudden surge of pain in her right leg and fell on her back by
    his head. She was panting now the way she did after doing the
    200-meter dash twice for physical tests.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She'd
    won. But she also felt empty. The actual fight might have lasted less
    than thirty seconds. She wouldn't have survived a longer fight. In
    any case...she won. That's what mattered.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    held her blood-soaked right leg as she looked down at the corpse of
    Kazushi, who resembled a traveling magician attempting to spit out an
    ice pick from his throat. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Now
    ladies and gentlemen, I shall spit out what I just swallowed—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Takako.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    voice came from behind her. Still seated, Takako turned around. She
    reached out and pulled out the ice pick from Kazushi's mouth (which
    resulted in Kazushi's head rising a little and then falling to the
    ground).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    Souma (Female Student No. II) was looking down at Takako.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    quickly looked over at Mitsuko's right hand. Her small hand was
    holding a large automatic pistol.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    had no idea what her intentions were. But, if like Kazushi Niida she
    intended to play the game (this after all was </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Mitsuko
    Souma</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">),
    Takako had no chance of winning. Mitsuko had a gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    had to escape. She had to. Takako pulled at her right leg in pain and
    tried to get up.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you all right?&quot; Mitsuko asked. Her voice sounded terribly kind.
    She didn't point the gun at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Takako had to be cautious. She moved back and finally managed to get
    up by holding onto a tree nearby. Her right leg felt incredibly
    heavy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    answered, &quot;Well, I suppose.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    looked over Kazushi's corpse. Then she looked at the ice pick in
    Takako's hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    killed him with that? I have to say I'm impressed. Speaking as one
    girl to another.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    really sounded like she was impressed. It almost sounded cheerful.
    Her angelic face was beaming.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    guess,&quot; Takako responded. She felt as if her body were off
    balance. Perhaps it was from the heavy loss of blood from her right
    leg.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Say,&quot;
    Mitsuko said. &quot;You never went out of your way to impress me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    unable to tell what Mitsuko's intentions were, Takako stared at her.
    (The two most beautiful girls in Shiroiwa Junior High were staring at
    each other. Nice jewelry and a boy's corpse. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh,
    you're so pretty.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    was absolutely right. Takako couldn't stand sucking up to anyone, so
    she was never intimidated like the other girls when Mitsuko talked to
    her. She was too proud and besides, she wasn't scared of Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she remembered something an older student she had a crush on a while
    ago (actually, it ended only a couple months ago) used to say.
    Whereas her feelings for Hiroki Sugimura were vague, she definitely
    had a crush on this guy. After getting involved in one of his
    friend's fights, he showed up all beat up at the team room before one
    of their meets and said in his unique voice, &quot;There's nothing to
    be afraid of. Nothing to fear.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Be
    strong and beautiful</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">....Takako
    had her eye on this guy ever since she entered junior high and it
    seemed he'd had a profound effect on her personality. But he also had
    a girlfriend. Someone very elegant, yes, someone like Sakura Ogawa,
    someone calm as a serene lake hidden deep inside a forest. Well, that
    was all in the past.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But,
    Takako thought, the fact that she suddenly recalled his words which
    hadn't occurred to her even when she was fighting Kazushi Niida just
    moments ago...Did that mean that she was in fact afraid of Mitsuko?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    was always a little envious,&quot; Mitsuko continued. &quot;You were
    so pretty, and you were a better girl than me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    listened quietly. She immediately realized there was something wrong.
    Why was Mitsuko referring to her in the past tense?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But—&quot;
    Mitsuko's eyes twinkled playfully. Now she was back to the present
    tense. &quot;I really like girls like you. Maybe I'm a bit of a dyke.
    So it's...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako's
    eyes opened wide. She turned around and began running. Her right leg
    dragged a little, but it was still a respectable sprint for the track
    star.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    it's...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    lifted the .45. She pulled the trigger three times in a row. Takako
    had managed to run down the hill and through the woods, covering a
    quick twenty meters when three holes appeared in the back of her
    uniform. She fell forward as if diving in a head-first slide. Face
    down, she slid across the ground, and her legs contrasted against
    each other, the left one white and the right one red as they flew
    into the air, her&nbsp;skirt fluttering against them. She was lying
    on the ground.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko

    breathing grew heavier. Shogo's medicine didn't seem to be having
    much effect. It was close to 2 p.m. All of a sudden Noriko's cheeks
    appeared sunk in. Shuya used up a water bottle to moisten Noriko's
    handkerchief, and wiped her sweaty face, and then placed it on her
    forehead. Noriko kept her eyes closed, but nodded as if to thank him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked back at Shogo. Shogo remained in the same position, leaning
    against a tree all this time, smoking with his legs crossed. His
    right hand gently touched the grip of the Remington shotgun resting
    in his lap.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's

    Noriko. &quot;She's getting worse every second.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    glanced at Noriko, who was lying down with her eyes closed. &quot;If
    it's from septicemia, warming her up and letting her rest won't cure
    her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    did his best to restrain his impatience. &quot;According to the map,
    there's a medical clinic on the island. We might be able to find some
    better medicine for her there, right? It's way north of the
    residential area, and it's not in any of the forbidden zones.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    tilted his head. He took another drag and then rubbed out the
    cigarette. &quot;That facility is at least one and a half kilometers
    away. It's too dangerous to go there now. We have to wait until
    dark.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    clenched his teeth. &quot;We can't wait until dark. What if that area

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,&quot;
    Shuya said. He wasn't sure whether it was from impatience or the mere
    thought of having to risk falling out with Shogo, but he was
    beginning to stutter a little. He had to say it though. &quot;I-I
    won't say you're trying to get us killed. But why are you so afraid
    of taking any risks? Your life that precious?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked him in the eye. Shogo didn't change his calm expression.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    heard Noriko's voice behind him and turned around. Noriko had her
    head turned toward him. The&nbsp;handkerchief on her forehead was
    lying on the ground.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it. We won't make it without Shogo,&quot; she managed to say in

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko.&quot;
    Shuya shook his head. &quot;Don't you see how weak you're getting?
    You can't die before we can make it out of here.&quot; Shuya turned
    to Shogo again. &quot;If you say you're not coming, I'll take Noriko
    with me on my own. You can forget about our deal. You're on your
    own.&quot; That was his parting remark as he got ready to get their
    bags.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on,&quot; Shogo said. He slowly got up, approached Noriko, and
    checked the pulse of her right wrist. It was what he did every twenty
    minutes. He rubbed his increasingly stubbly chin again and looked at
    them. &quot;You won't know what medicine to use.&quot; He tilted his
    head slightly, looked at Shuya, and said, &quot;All right. I'm coming
    with you.&quot;</font></font></p>

    wound in her leg, Takako Chigusa was still alive. Mitsuko Souma had
    disappeared, but Takako couldn't care less about that.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    could tell her sister Ayako, who was two years younger, was crying.
    She was saying, &quot;Goodbye, Takako, goodbye.&quot; Her handsome
    father, (from whom Takako had inherited most of her features) and her
    mother (who shared her looks more with Ayako), were both silent,
    looking very sad. Their pet dog, Hanako, drooped her head and wagged
    her tail. Takako had taken care of Hanako, smart female dog, ever

    was the guy she had a crush on. He was good at running hurdles. Now
    he was concentrating on taping up his knee which he'd injured a while
    ago. There was no one else besides them. Takako said, &quot;You have

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako
    smiled, but felt a little odd. She was happy to hear him praise her

    she was prettier also indicated how strong his relationship with his

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay...&quot;

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Come
    to think of it, Hiroki started martial arts school the year after
    that. He also went through a growth spurt around then and eventually
    ended up taller than her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Up
    until the end of elementary school they often visited each other.
    Once, when she seemed preoccupied, Hiroki asked her, &quot;What's

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Takako

    gently lifted up her head. She'd fallen face forward, but now for
    some reason she was facing up. The palm of her left hand (her left
    hand...no, the entire left side of her body was numb now, so she
    couldn't feel anything; it might have been from Kazushi Niida's blow
    to the side of her head) felt the sensation of weeds underneath—had
    he carried her here?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki

    Takako thought. So it was true. After she ran away from the school
    into the woods she thought she'd heard a distant voice. But she was
    so frantic she thought it was just her imagination—and if it
    wasn't, then it meant there was someone—so she continued running at
    full speed.</font></font></p>

    had waited for her. Just as she'd suspected, he'd been waiting for

    probably meant that he'd been looking for her all this time.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    She tried to come up with the best thing to say, but then an odd
    question occurred to her and she blurted it out, &quot;Do you have a
    crush on someone?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki's

    took a deep breath. She felt as if poison were spreading through her
    body which strangely felt both chilly and at the same time incredibly
    hot. &quot;Could you just...hold me tight? It'll be over soon.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    tightened his lips and raised her up, hugging her tightly to his body

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Get
    down,&quot; Shogo said. He carefully surveyed the area while holding
    on to his shotgun. Carrying Noriko on his back, Shuya obeyed Shogo.
    The area was shaded by a large elm tree. They must&nbsp;have covered
    two-thirds the distance to the medical facility by now. They should
    be in the vicinity of sector F-6 or F-7. If they were headed in the
    right direction (Shogo was leading them, so they couldn't be far
    off), the school building should soon appear below them to their
    right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Moving
    along the shore, they first passed through C-4. Then they moved east
    along the foot of the northern mountain. Moving in broad daylight did
    turn out to be difficult. They would move a little, quiet down their
    breathing, and when they had to get through thick vegetation Shogo
    would throw several pebbles ahead to make sure no one was there. It'd
    already taken them half an hour just to get this far.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    continued to breathe heavily.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    tilted his head back the way mothers do with their infants and told
    her, &quot;We're almost there, Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh
    huh...&quot; she answered.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right, let's go,&quot; Shogo said. &quot;We're going for that tree
    over there.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Got
    it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    got up and proceeded through the soft, grassy soil that must have
    been a farm field. Shogo was right next to them, holding their
    belongings with his left hand and his shotgun in his right,
    indicating directions with the motion of his head. The muzzle of the
    shotgun would point in the same direction as his head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    reached a thin tree and stopped. Shuya took a deep breath.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you all right, Shuya?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    gave him a smile. &quot;Noriko's light.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    can take a break.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,&quot;
    Shuya shook his head. &quot;I want to get there as soon as possible.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right,&quot; Shogo said, but Shuya felt uncertain. Maybe he was being
    an idiot. He was always jumping to wrong conclusions, failing to
    check the important details.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Does
    that mark on the map really indicate a clinic?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    snickered. &quot;I believe you were the one who claimed it did.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    that was—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was embarrassed, but Shogo immediately said, &quot;Don't worry, it
    is. I checked it.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    I walked around the island last night until I met you guys. I should
    have had the foresight to take some more medicine. I didn't think I'd
    need it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    let out a sigh of relief. Then he reproached himself. He had to get
    his act together. Otherwise, he'd end up not only getting himself
    killed but Noriko as well.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even
    as they talked, Shogo was searching for their next spot.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    they heard the gunfire. Shogo froze. He nervously crouched down and
    surveyed the area. So had Shuya been too optimistic, hoping they
    could reach the medical facility without any obstacles?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    there was no one in sight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked over at Shogo, who stretched out his left arm as if to shield
    them and looked ahead toward their left, where they were headed.
    There was a gentle slope leading up to rows of tall pine trees
    approximately ten meters away, cutting off their view. Did he mean
    they were going through there?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    finally let out the breath he'd been holding.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    all right,&quot; Shogo said in a hushed voice. &quot;We're not the
    targets.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    decided against pulling out his gun and, still carrying Noriko, said,
    &quot;It's close.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded silently. Then the gunfire continued. Two, then three shots.
    The third one somehow seemed louder than the first two shots. Then
    another shot. It was a smaller sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;A
    gun fight,&quot; Shogo mumbled. &quot;They're pretty pumped up.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    that he knew they were safe, Shuya felt relieved, but he kept on
    biting his lip.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whoever
    they were, his classmates were trying to kill each other again. In
    fact, it was happening right near them. And he was just trying to
    stay quiet, waiting for it to end. That was just...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    image of the men in black crossed his mind. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Now
    then, you're next, and you. Fortunately, Mr. Nanahara, your time
    still hasn't come.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    back facing him, Shogo said, as if he could read Shuya's thoughts
    (didn't he say something silly about reading his mind on a clear
    day?), &quot;I hope you're not thinking of stopping them, Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    held his breath and then mumbled, &quot;No.&quot; His priority was to
    take Noriko to the medical facility. If they got mixed up with
    someone else's fight they'd end up risking their own lives.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Noriko suddenly said from behind, &quot;Shuya.&quot; Her fever was so
    high, he could even feel it through his back. She was practically
    whispering.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned his head around. He saw Noriko's eyes squinting right behind
    his shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Let
    me stand...&quot; she finally uttered and continued, &quot;We have to
    see...make sure...whoever it is...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    words were cut off by her heavy breathing, but he knew what she was
    getting at. What if someone who didn't want to participate, in other
    words, someone innocent, was about to get killed right now? In fact
    that could be the case with both parties exchanging bullets right
    now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    area they were in was a direct southward descent from the northern
    peak where Yukiko Kitano and Yumiko Kusaka were killed. But they
    weren't hearing a machine gun now. Therefore, neither of the fighting
    parties right now had killed Yukiko and Yumiko. But what if...Yukiko
    and Yumiko's killer heard&nbsp;this gunfire? He could show up at any
    moment.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More
    gunfire was exchanged. And then silence again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    clenched his teeth. He quickly let Noriko down. He had her rest
    against the tree trunk where they were hiding.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    turned around. &quot;Hey, you're not...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    ignored him and said to Noriko, &quot;I'll go check it out.&quot; He
    pulled out his Smith &amp; Wesson and said to Shogo, &quot;Look after
    Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;H-hey...&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    heard Shogo, but he was already on his way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    climbed the slope carefully, keeping an eye on all sides, and made
    his way through the coniferous trees.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was thick vegetation beyond the trees. Shuya made his way into it. He
    got down on the ground and proceeded to make his way through the
    long, sharp needles pricking at him from both sides.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More
    gunshots. Shuya finally reached the edge of the grove and slowly
    poked his head out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a house. It was an old wooden, single-story building with a
    triangular roof. A typical farmhouse. On his left was an unpaved
    entrance road. The mountain escarpment surrounded the property
    further down. The area above was covered in deep forest. And even
    further up, you could see the viewing platform on the northern
    mountain where Yumiko and Yukiko had been killed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    farmhouse was on his left side. Hirono Shimizu (Female Student No.
    10) was crouched against the wall in front of the building. Hirono
    was looking beyond the yard at what appeared to be a shack for farm
    equipment right beside the entrance road. He could make out the
    figure of a girl beside the entrance. The girl looked up, and that
    was when he realized it was Kaori Minami (Female Student No. 20). And
    both of them were holding guns. They were less than fifteen meters
    apart from each other.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    had no idea how they ended up shooting at each other. It was possible
    one of them was out to get the other girl, but Shuya could tell this
    wasn't the case. They probably stumbled into each other, and because
    neither of them could trust the other, they ended up shooting at each
    other....</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    guess might have just been based on his own favorable opinion of
    girls, but in any case he couldn't just sit back and let this happen.
    He had to stop them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Shuya tried to grasp the situation, Kaori stuck her head out from the
    shack's entrance and fired at Hirono. She handled the gun like a kid
    playing with a water pistol, but unlike a water pistol the gun
    exploded, and a small brass shell flew into the air. Hirono fired two
    shots back. She actually handled the gun well, and her shells didn't
    fly out. One of her bullets hit the post of the shack, which
    shattered into sawdust. Kaori quickly tucked her head in.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono's
    body was almost entirely visible from where Shuya was standing, and
    he saw her open the cylinder of her revolver to extract the shells.
    Her left hand was soaked crimson. Her arm might have been wounded by
    Kaori. But she managed to reload her gun quickly with that hand. She
    aimed her gun at Kaori again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    of this happened in a matter of seconds, but right before he was
    about to act Shuya was once again&nbsp;overwhelmed by the sensation
    of being in a nightmare. Kaori Minami loved pop idols, so she'd often
    talk about her favorite stars with her friends, or share a photo
    taken in person that thrilled her to no end. Then there was Hirono
    Shimizu, who hung out with Mitsuko Souma, so there was something
    jaded about her. But they were both third-year students in junior
    high, they both had charming qualities. Now these two were shooting
    at each other. Seriously, with real bullets. Obviously.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stood up and fifed his Smith &amp; Wesson into the air. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    great, so now I'm playing the sheriff</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    he&nbsp;thought for a moment. But without hesitating, he shouted,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    and Kaori froze, and then together looked over at Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    continued, &quot;Stop it! I'm with Noriko Nakagawa!&quot; He thought
    it was best not to mention Shogo's name for now. &quot;You can trust
    me!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he said this, he realized how lame his words sounded. But he had no
    other way to put it.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    was the first to move her eyes away from Shuya to Kaori. And Kaori
    was gazing at Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized at that moment how half of Kaori's body was exposed beyond
    the entrance—she was in the open now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What
    happened next reminded him of a traffic accident he once witnessed.
    It happened on an autumn evening before he turned eleven. Maybe the
    driver had fallen asleep or something. His truck lost control, rammed
    through the guardrail, rode up onto the sidewalk, and hit a young
    girl walking home from school, just like Shuya, who was behind her.
    It was unbelievable but her backpack came off her shoulders and flew
    into the air, tracing a different trajectory from the girl's body.
    The girl landed on the sidewalk before the backpack did, falling on
    her shoulder. Obstructed by the wayside concrete wall she slid along
    the edge of the sidewalk and then stopped still. Blood came flowing
    out, leaving a trail on the bottom edge of the concrete wall over one
    meter long.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    all looked like—from the time the truck swung off the road and
    crashed into the girl—as if it was happening in slow motion. Anyone
    there could tell what was going to happen, but there was nothing
    anyone could do. That's what it felt like.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    aimed and fired at Kaori, who'd completely let her guard down. Two
    shots in a row. The first one hit Kaori in the shoulder, making her
    spin halfway to the right. The second shot hit her in the head. Shuya
    saw a part of her head—from the top down to her left
    temple—explode.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    collapsed by the front door of the shack.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    glanced over at Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she turned and ran to his left, westward, where Shuya's group came
    from. She ran into the bushes and disappeared from sight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    moaned. After some hesitation he ran to the shack where Kaori had
    collapsed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    was lying down, legs jutting out from inside the shack that only
    housed a decrepit tractor. Her body remained twisted as blood came
    flowing out the corner of her mouth, mixed with the blood from her
    head and shoulder wounds, turning into a puddle on the shack's
    concrete floor. Tiny dust particles&nbsp;from the floor were floating
    on the surface of the puddle. Her eyes stared out at the sky. A thin
    gold chain hung down from her sailor suit onto the floor, and the
    golden locket attached to it looked like an island in a lake of
    blood. A famous male idol singer was smiling cheerfully from it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was shaking as he knelt down beside her.</font></font></p>

    man...what the...so this girl...can't gossip about pop idols anymore,
    she can't go to their concerts anymore. If he had been more
    careful...maybe she wouldn't have been killed?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    heard a sound and turned around. It was Shogo, holding Noriko with
    one of his arms as they looked out from the woods.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    left Noriko there and trotted over to Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    expression seemed to be saying, &quot;See, what'd I tell you?&quot;
    but he didn't say a word. He just calmly picked up Kaori's gun and
    day pack, and then as if it occurred to him as an afterthought, he
    crouched down and shut her eyes with his right thumb. Then he told
    Shuya, &quot;We're going. Hurry up.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    knew it was dangerous. Anyone—especially the killer with the
    machine gun—could have heard the gunfire and might be showing up
    now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still,
    Shuya's eyes were glued to Kaori's corpse until Shogo tugged his arm
    back.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    medical clinic was an old, small, single-story building. The wood
    walls had turned black, and the black-tiled roof was so worn out with
    age that the corners had turned white. Like the shack where Kaori
    Minami had died, it was located in front of the northern mountain at
    the end of a narrow unpaved road. They'd made their way through the
    mountain, but they could tell the narrow entrance road led down to
    the paved road along the island's eastern shore. There was a white
    minivan parked in front of the facility. Maybe the doctor had used
    it. Beyond the minivan they could see the ocean.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    afternoon sun was shining on the sea. The color of the ocean was
    completely different from the murky water that lapped against the
    concrete sea walls in Shiroiwa harbor. It was a wonderfully brilliant
    blue tinged with green. There were hardly any waves, and the
    sparkling dots of light on its surface became increasingly dense in
    the distance. Other islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea looked
    remarkably close, but this was probably due, as he was once told, to
    the optical illusion of reduced distance when objects were absent. So
    they must have been at least four or five kilometers away.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    any case they were here. It was a miracle they got here without
    getting hurt. They'd immediately left the area where Kaori died. No
    machine gun shots came after them. According to the map they'd
    traveled a distance of less than two kilometers, but Shuya, who'd
    been carrying Noriko, accompanied by the pressure of a possible
    attack, was incredibly tired. He wanted to check to make sure no one
    was in the area of the clinic as soon as possible, so that not only
    Noriko but he too could get some rest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    something caught Shuya's attention.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    ship was floating on the peaceful sea. It was probably the guard ship
    Sakamochi had mentioned. But...for some reason there were three ships
    in a row. Sakamochi said there would be one ship on all sides—north,
    south, east, and west—and on the west side they had only seen one.
    So what was this?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    carrying Noriko, Shuya poked his face out from the leaves and asked
    Shogo, &quot;There're three ships.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    Shogo replied. &quot;The small one is a guard ship. The huge one is
    the ship that will transport the soldiers who were in the school
    building back to their base. The one in the middle is for the winner
    of the game. The winner rides that boat. It's the same model as the
    one from last year.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So,
    the Program in Hyogo Prefecture was also held on an island like this
    one?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yep,&quot;
    Shogo nodded. &quot;Hyogo Prefecture also shares the Seto Inland Sea.
    It seems like Programs held in prefectures along the Seto Inland Sea
    coast are always held on islands. I mean, there are at least a
    thousand islands in this small ocean.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    then told him to wait and descended the slope toward the clinic with
    his shotgun cocked. He crouched down and first examined the minivan.
    Then he snuck up to the building and circled it. When he returned he
    examined the sliding door entrance. It seemed to be locked, so Shogo
    flipped his shotgun and shattered the frosted glass window with the
    sawed off gun stock. Then he stuck his hand into the V-shaped
    opening, unlocked the door, and entered the building.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    watching him do this, Shuya tilted his head back to Noriko, whose
    head was resting against his back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko,
    we're here.&quot; Shuya said, but Noriko could only moan, &quot;Huh...&quot;
    Her heavy breathing continued.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    five full minutes, Shogo poked his head out of the entrance and
    signaled Shuya to join him. Shuya cautiously descended the two meter
    drop so he wouldn't lose his balance and approached the clinic.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    thick, grimy wooden sign with the traces of weatherworn letters that
    read, &quot;Okishima Island Medical Clinic&quot; hung right beside
    the entrance. Shuya slipped by Shogo, who kept watch, holding his
    shotgun. He entered, followed by Shogo, who shut the door tightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    near the entrance, there was a small waiting room. On the left there
    was a long green couch with a white cover on the worn out
    cream-colored carpet. The wall clock made a ticking sound as it
    approached three o'clock. The right side appeared to be the
    examination room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    jammed the door shut with a broom and then signaled Shuya, &quot;Over
    here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    they were supposed to take their shoes off, Shuya stepped up with his
    sneakers on and entered the room on the right. There was a wooden
    desk in front of the window, and what appeared to be a doctor's black
    leather chair. There was a green vinyl stool in front of it. Even
    though the clinic was small, it still had the sterile odor of
    disinfectant.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    were two beds beyond a thin green curtain hanging from metal pipes.
    Shuya carried Noriko to the bed in front and gently put her down
    there. He thought of having her take off his school coat, but then
    decided against it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    Shogo quickly pulled the curtains shut, he said, &quot;blankets,&quot;
    and gave him two thin brown blankets folded in small squares. Shuya
    took them and after some thought spread one of them on the other bed.
    Then he moved Noriko there and spread the other blanket over her. He
    made sure the blanket went up to her shoulders. Shogo was rummaging
    through a gray office cabinet that was probably the medicine cabinet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    crouched down by Noriko's head and combed the sweaty hair against her
    cheeks back to her ears. She seemed dazed. Her eyes were closed, and
    she continued to breathe heavily.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn
    it,&quot; Shuya muttered. &quot;Noriko, are you all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    squinted, her eyes glazed at him as she said, &quot;Uh huh...&quot;
    She might be faint from the high fever, but her mind was clear enough
    to respond.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    about some water?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    barely nodded. Shuya took out a new bottle of water from the day pack
    Shogo had tossed onto the floor and tore off the seal. He held her up
    and helped her drink it. Shuya wiped off the water spilling from the
    side of her mouth with the back of his hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Is
    that enough?&quot; Shuya asked and Noriko nodded. Then he lay her
    down and waved to Shogo. &quot;Any medicine?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on,&quot; Shogo replied. He rummaged through another, lower cabinet
    and pulled out a cardboard box. He opened it and read the directions.
    It seemed to be what he was after. He extracted what looked like a
    small bottle and an ampoule. The bottle was filled with white powder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Do
    you swallow that?&quot; Shuya asked.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    answered, &quot;No, it's for injections.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was a little shocked. &quot;You know how to use that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    turned on the faucet in the back of the room. No water came out, as
    expected, and Shogo clicked his tongue. He pulled out his water
    bottle from his day pack and washed his hands. Then he set a needle
    on a syringe and extracted the contents of the ampoule. &quot;Don't
    worry, I've done this before.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Really?&quot;
    Shuya felt like he was constantly repeating this phrase to Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    broke the seal of the small bottle and injected it with the syringe,
    filling it up with the liquid from the ampoule. After removing the
    syringe, he held the bottle and shook it vigorously. Then he injected
    the syringe again to extract the liquid mixture.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    preparing another syringe like this, he finally approached them.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Is
    she going to be all right?&quot; Shuya asked again. &quot;What about
    side effects or shock?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    what I'm going to check for now. Just do as I say. Pull out Noriko's
    arm.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unsure
    of the situation, Shuya lifted the side of the blanket and rolled up
    both the sleeves of his school coat and her sailor suit. Her arm was
    very thin and her healthy looking dark skin had now become
    excruciatingly white.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko,&quot;
    Shogo asked her, &quot;have you ever had any allergic reactions to
    any medicine?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    opened her eyes again in a daze.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    repeated, &quot;Are you allergic to any medicine?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    shook her head slightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Good.
    I'm going to test you first though.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    held her arm out with her palm up, then took a cotton swab soaked
    with disinfectant and wiped&nbsp;the area between her wrist and
    elbow. He slowly inserted the needle, injecting only a small amount
    of the liquid. A slight bump formed on this area of her skin. Shogo
    took out another syringe and performed another injection.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    are you doing?&quot; Shuya asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;One
    of them is real medicine. If she's in the same condition fifteen
    minutes later, we won't have to worry about side effects. It means we
    can probably use the medicine. But...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    quickly took out another larger bottle from the cardboard box. He
    placed it on the small desk nearby, prepared another syringe, and
    looked over at Shuya. &quot;It's not easy to diagnose septicemia. To
    be honest I can't tell whether this is from septicemia or just a
    cold. Antibiotics are pretty potent, and that's why we're testing
    this on her, but the fact is my experience and knowledge is pretty
    limited, so injecting her with this syringe could be pretty dicey. On
    the other hand...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding
    Noriko's hand, Shuya waited for him to continue.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took a breath and continued, &quot;If she is suffering from
    septicemia, then we have to treat her as soon as possible. Otherwise,
    it'll be too late.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fifteen
    minutes passed by quickly. In the meantime, Shogo checked her pulse
    again and took her temperature. The thermometer read 39 degrees
    Celsius. No wonder she could barely stand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    couldn't tell the difference between the two adjacent marks from the
    syringes. Shogo also appeared to reach the same conclusion and took
    the larger syringe.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Crouching
    down slightly, Shogo asked, &quot;Noriko. Are you awake?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    answered with her eyes shut, &quot;Uh huh...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    be honest. I don't know if you're suffering from septicemia or not. I
    think you probably are.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded slightly. She must have been able to follow Shuya and Shogo's
    conversation moments ago.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    all right...go ahead.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded and inserted the syringe, this time deeply.&nbsp;He injected
    the liquid and removed the needle. Then he wiped her arm with the
    cotton and told Shuya, &quot;Hold this.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took the empty syringe and walked over to the sink to toss it away.
    Then he came back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Now
    she's got to sleep. You look after her for a while. If she looks
    thirsty, you can use the whole bottle.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    said, &quot;But that's—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    worry. I found a well behind the building. As long as we boil the
    water we can drink it.&quot; Shogo left the room. Shuya turned
    towards the bed. With his right hand pressing the cotton swab and his
    left hand</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    fell asleep almost immediately. Shuya checked to make sure she wasn't
    bleeding from the shot, then he tossed the cotton swab, tucked her
    arm under the blanket, and left the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    doctor's living quarters was beyond the waiting room next door. There
    was a kitchen at the end of the hall on the right. Shogo was in
    there. The gas stove next to the sink wasn't operating, but on it was
    a large pot filled with water, and under it a pile of charcoal was
    glowing red.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    was standing on a table, looking through a built-in ceiling cabinet
    across from the sink. That's when Shuya noticed for the first time
    that Shogo was wearing New Balance sneakers. He'd assumed they were
    some domestic brand like Mizumo or Kageboshi. New Balance! He'd never
    seen them before!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whatever.
    &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    looking for food. I found some rice and miso, but nothing else. The
    vegetables in the fridge are rotten.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head. &quot;You're stealing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Of
    course I am,&quot; Shogo said dryly and then added while he continued
    rummaging, &quot;Forget about it. Just be ready. Anyone could show up
    at any moment. If the machine gun shooter shows up, we'll be dead. So
    be ready.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    replied, &quot;Yeah, all right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    jumped off the table. The New Balance shoes squeaked against the
    floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Is
    she asleep?&quot; he asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    pulled out another pot from under the sink, walked up to the plastic
    rice container in the corner, and poured rice into the pot.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you're boiling rice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yep.
    Noriko won't recover eating that terrible bread.&quot; Shogo scooped
    up a bowl of water from the bucket on the floor and poured it into
    the pot. He combed through the rice and only changed the water once.
    Next to the boiling water, he placed several pieces of charcoal from
    his day pack onto the other burner, then took out a pack of
    cigarettes and emptied them into his pocket. Then he crumpled the
    pack, lit it with his lighter, and stuck it into the charcoal. Once
    the charcoal was lit, he put the lidded pot of rice on the burner. It
    was an impressive sight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn,&quot;
    Shuya said.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took a break as he lit up a cigarette and looked at Shuya.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You're
    so good at everything.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah?&quot;
    Shogo answered lightly. But something else flashed through Shuya's
    mind. The moment Kaori Minami was murdered...</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>you
    know what's going to happen but there's nothing you can do to stop
    it. Slow motion. Kaori spins around and the left side of her head's
    blown off. It was blown away, did you see that?&nbsp;</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
    it had been Shogo instead of Shuya, the outcome wouldn't have been so
    horrible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you still bummed about Kaori?&quot; Shogo said. Once again, Shogo's
    psychic powers were on. The sunlight doesn't reach this far inside,
    but that didn't seem to affect him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head. &quot;Don't let it get to you. It was a bad
    situation. You did your best.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    voice was kind, but Shuya looked down. The corpse of Kaori Minami,
    collapsed on her side inside a grimy farm equipment shack. The pool
    of blood gradually spreading, oozing outward. By now, beginning to
    congeal. But the body would just stay there, with no ceremony, just
    left there like a disposed mannequin sprawled inside that shack. Of
    course in that sense she was no exception to Tatsumichi Oki, Kyoichi
    Motobuchi, Yukiko Kitano, and Yumiko Kusaka. Everyone else was in the
    same boat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt like puking. They were all lying there, on the ground. Already
    close to twenty of them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo.&quot;
    The words spilled out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    response Shogo tilted his head and slightly moved his hand that was
    holding the cigarette.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    happens to the dead...their bodies?&quot; Shuya asked. &quot;Are they
    left there until this stupid game is over? So they just start rotting
    while the game is going on?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    answered as if it were an official matter. &quot;That's right. Once
    it's over, the following day a clean-up crew is hired to take care of
    them.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Clean-up
    crew?&quot; Shuya bared his teeth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yep.
    I heard about it from someone who works for the subcontractor, so I'm
    sure it's true. Self Defense Forces soldiers are too proud to perform
    such menial tasks. Of course, government officials accompany the crew
    to collect the collars and examine the bodies. You know, so the news
    media can report the number of deaths by strangulation, all that
    stuff.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was pissed. He recalled that final part of the news report. The
    meaningless causes of deaths and itemization of each student.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he also realized something and knit his brows.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    saw this and asked, &quot;What's up?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    that doesn't make sense. I mean these...&quot; Shuya raised his hand
    up to his neck. His fingers touched the collar's cold surface, its
    sensation no longer so strange. &quot;I thought these were a secret.
    Shouldn't they collect them before the hired hands come in?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged. &quot;The cleaning crew have no idea what they're for. They
    probably just assume they're used as markers. The guy I talked to
    didn't even remember them until I asked him about them. So there's no
    rush. They can deal with the collars after the clean-up crew's
    collected the bodies, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was true. But even so, something else bugged him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on. What if one of these is defective? Let's say it breaks down and
    someone who's alive is&nbsp;assumed to be dead. Couldn't that student
    escape? Shouldn't they confirm all the dead right after the game?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    raised his brows. &quot;You talk like you work for the government.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No...&quot;
    he stammered. &quot;It's just that—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    doubt they could ever be defective. Think about it. If they actually
    could break down, this game couldn't proceed smoothly. Besides, if a
    student equipped with weapons turned out to be alive, they couldn't
    even afford to check the bodies. It'd turn into another battle.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took a drag as he considered it more thoroughly. &quot;This is just
    my guess, but I think each collar is loaded with multiple systems, so
    that if one breaks down, another gets switched on. Even if one system
    became defective—the chances of that being at least less than one
    in a hundred—if the systems were combined the probability would
    practically be reduced to zero. In other words,&quot; he said,
    looking at Shuya, &quot;it would be impossible for us to escape that
    way.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    understood. He saw no reason not to object. (Once again, he couldn't
    help but be impressed by Shogo's intelligence.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    question he promised not to ask crossed his mind. Which was:&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	How
    did Shogo plan to beat a perfect, escape-proof system?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    he could consider it, Shogo said, &quot;Anyway, look, I have to
    apologize.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;About
    what?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;About
    Noriko. I was wrong. We should have treated her sooner.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No—&quot;
    Shuya shook his head. &quot;It's okay. Thanks. I would have been
    useless on my own.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    exhaled and fixed his gaze on a part of the wall. &quot;We'll just
    have to wait and see. If it's just a cold, then her fever will go
    down as soon as she gets some rest. And if it turns out it's from
    septicemia then the medicine should kick in.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. He was grateful they had Shogo. Without Shogo, he would have
    been helpless, doomed to watch Noriko deteriorate. He was also sorry
    for saying to Shogo, &quot;You can forget about our deal,&quot; and
    heading off here. It was immature. Shogo must have made his decision
    after carefully weighing the risk of moving during the day against
    Noriko's condition.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    decided he should apologize. &quot;Hey, I'm sorry. Saying you were on
    your own and all. I just got so excited—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    looking away from Shuya, Shogo shook his head and smiled. &quot;No.
    You made the right decision. End of conversation.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a breath and decided to let it go. Then he asked, &quot;Is your
    father still a practicing doctor?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head as he took a drag. &quot;No.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    he doing? Is he still in Kobe?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.
    He died.&quot; Shogo said it casually.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    eyes opened wide. &quot;When?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Last
    year, while I was playing this game. By the time I got back he was
    dead. He probably got in a scuffle with the government.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    face stiffened. He was beginning to understand the glimmer in Shogo's
    eyes when he'd said, &quot;I'm going to tear up this fucking
    country.&quot; The moment Shogo ended up in the Program, Shogo's
    father must have tried some kind of protest. Which must have been met
    with a shower of bullets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    occurred to Shuya that the parents of some of his classmates might
    have ended up the same way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    sorry. I didn't mean to pry.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    worry about it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    paused and then asked another question, &quot;Then you moved to
    Kagawa Prefecture with your mother?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head and again replied, &quot;No. My mom died when I was a
    kid. I was seven. She died from illness. My dad used to cry over the
    fact that he couldn't even save her. But my dad specialized in
    surgery, like abortions. Nervous disorders were out of his field.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    apologized again, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    chuckled. &quot;Hey, it's all right. We both don't have parents,
    right? And it's true about getting a lifetime pension. I've got
    enough to live on. Although they don't give you as much as they say
    they do.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Bubbles
    began to form at the bottom of the first large pot. The charcoal
    under the rice pot was still mostly black, but the charcoal under the
    large pot was flaming red. The heat reached the table where Shuya and
    Shogo were standing next to each other. Shuya sat up on the table,
    which was covered with a flower-pattern vinyl tablecloth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    warning, Shogo suddenly said, &quot;You were good friends with
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked over at Shogo and looked at his profile. Then he looked ahead.
    It felt like a while since he'd last thought of Yoshitoki. He felt a
    little guilty about it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    he answered. &quot;We've known each other forever.&quot; After
    hesitating a little, Shuya continued, &quot;Yoshitoki had a crush on
    Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    continued smoking, listening.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wondered whether he should continue with what he was about to say. It
    had nothing to do with Shogo. But he decided to tell him anyway.
    Shogo was a friend now. It was all right for him to know, and
    besides, they had time to kill right now.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yoshitoki
    and I were at this orphanage called the Charity House—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    know.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded and continued, &quot;There're all kinds of kids there. I ended
    up there when I was five. My parents were killed in a car accident.
    But that's unusual. Most of them—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    understood. &quot;They end up there because of 'domestic' problems.
    They're illegitimate children.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. &quot;So you know.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;A
    little.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    took a deep breath. &quot;Well, Yoshitoki was illegitimate. Of
    course, no one at the orphanage told him, but there are ways to find
    out. He was conceived from an 'illicit affair' and both sides refused
    to take him in. So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    water made a gurgling sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    remember something Yoshitoki once said to me. It was a long time ago,
    probably when we were still in elementary school.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    recalled that moment. They were in the corner of the school
    playground, rocking back and forth on a big swing made of a wooden
    log and wire rope.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    Shuya. I was thinking—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    responded in his usual casual voice, kicking at the ground to rock
    the log. Yoshitoki didn't put much effort into it, letting his legs
    dangle from both sides of the log.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well...uh...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it? Spit it out.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well...do
    you have a crush on anyone?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    please,&quot; Shuya grinned. He knew it was something about girls.
    &quot;So that's it? What's the matter? You have a crush on someone,
    huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well...&quot;
    Yoshitoki evaded the question and once again asked, &quot;Well, do
    you?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought about it and then moaned, &quot;Hmmm.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    then he was &quot;Wild Seven.&quot; So he'd gotten several love
    letters. But at the time he never fell head over heels for anyone in
    particular. As it turned out, he wouldn't until he met Kazumi
    Shintani.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    answered, &quot;Well, I think there're some cool girls.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    didn't say anything back so he assumed he wanted to hear more. He
    continued speaking in a light tone, &quot;Komoto's not bad. She
    actually wrote me a love letter. I haven't, uh, responded though.
    Then there's Utsumi, who's on the volleyball team. She's pretty cool.
    That's my type. You know, real outgoing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    looked pensive.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it? I told you, now you tell me. Who is it?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Yoshitoki only said, &quot;No, that's not it.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knit his brows.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it then?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    seemed quite hesitant, but then he said, &quot;You see, I never
    really understood.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    mean...&quot; His legs dangled passively as he continued, &quot;I
    think if you really loved someone you'd marry her, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh,
    yeah.&quot; Shuya replied with an idiotic look on his face. &quot;Yeah.
    If I loved someone, I'd want to marry her...I mean I don't feel that
    way about anyone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Right?&quot;
    Yoshitoki said, as if it were only natural. Then he asked, &quot;So
    let's say you just can't get married for some reason. If you ended up
    having a kid with her, wouldn't you still want to raise the kid?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt a little uncomfortable. He'd just begun to get the idea of how
    babies were made.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Having
    a kid? Hey, you're still a kid. That's dirty stuff. You know I heard
    that that's—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when Shuya finally remembered Yoshitoki was born as a result of
    an illicit affair and that neither of his parents wanted him.
    Startled, he held back what he was about to say.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki
    was staring at the log between his thighs. Then he mumbled, &quot;My
    parents weren't like that.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    suddenly felt really bad for him.&nbsp;&quot;H-hey, Yoshi—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked up at Shuya and said somewhat forcefully, &quot;So I-I just
    don't know. Loving someone. I don't feel like I can trust that sort
    of thing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    continued pushing with his legs, but he had no choice but to stare
    back at Yoshitoki. He felt as if he were being addressed in a
    language from another planet. At the same time, it sounded like a
    dreadful prophecy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    think—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    hands by his waist, Shuya gripped the corners of the table covered
    with the vinyl tablecloth. Shogo continued smoking, squinting his
    eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    think Yoshitoki was a lot more mature at that point already. I was
    just a silly kid. And ever since then, Yoshitoki, even since we
    entered junior high, and I fell for someone,&quot; this was Kazumi
    Shintani, &quot;he never brought it up. That kind of worried me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another
    gurgling sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    then one day he told me he liked Noriko. I acted like it wasn't a big
    deal, but I was so happy for him. And that was, that was...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked away from Shogo. He knew he was about to cry.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    he managed to hold back his tears, he said without looking at Shogo
    and continued, &quot;That was only two months ago.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    remained silent.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at Shogo again.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you see, I have to protect Noriko to the very end.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    staring back at Shuya for a while, Shogo only said, &quot;I see,&quot;
    and rubbed out his cigarette out against the tablecloth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    tell Noriko. I'll tell her about Yoshitoki once we've gotten out of
    this game.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Five
    hours had passed since the Macintosh PowerBook 150's connection to
    the internet had been cut off with a warning beep. Shinji Mimura
    scrolled through a document in one of the windows on the display
    monitor of the 150 that was now reduced to a word processor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    worked on the phone, checked the connections, and rebooted over and
    over but the gray monitor responded with the same message. Finally,
    after disconnecting all the modem and phone cords, he came to the
    conclusion his cell phone had completely broke down. Without a phone
    line he couldn't even access his home computer. And of course,
    calling all the girls he'd ever gone with and sobbing over how he
    was, &quot;About to die, but I loved you the most,&quot; was out of
    the question. He still believed he could get to the bottom of this
    and considered taking apart his cell phone—but then stopped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    chill ran down his spine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was obvious now why he wasn't able to dial in anymore. The government
    had managed to locate the line test number used by the DTT
    technician, the number used for the special phone with the
    counterfeit &quot;Second ROM&quot; he'd painstakingly built. They'd
    cut off all connections including this one. The question was, how had
    they managed to do this? His hacking had been flawless. He knew that
    much.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    only way he could imagine the government discovering his hacking was
    through some method outside their computer's internal security
    system, their warning system, and other manual monitoring systems.
    And now that they knew—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    moment Shinji realized what it was, his hand went for the collar
    around his neck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    that the government knew, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the
    bomb went off, would it? They probably wouldn't spare Yutaka either.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thanks
    to this realization, the government-supplied water and bread they had
    for lunch tasted even worse.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    Yutaka saw Shinji turn off the laptop, he asked for an explanation.
    Shinji only replied, &quot;It's no good. I don't know why, but it's
    not working. Maybe the phone's broken.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ever
    since then Yutaka's mood became gloomy, and he slouched back to the
    way he'd been earlier that morning. Other than the occasional
    gunshots and brief exchanges it remained silent. Shinji's great
    escape plan that mesmerized Yutaka had completely fallen apart.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'll
    still make them regret they didn't kill me right away. No matter
    what.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    thought a little, then dug into his pants pocket and pulled out an
    old pocketknife he carried around with him ever since he was a kid.
    There was a small tube tied to the keyring on the knife. Shinji
    examined&nbsp;the scratched up tube.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    uncle had given him the knife a long time ago. And the tube was, like
    the earring on his left ear, another memento from his uncle. Like
    Shinji, his uncle had kept it chained to a small knife and always
    carried it around.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    thumb-sized tube, with its rubber ring under the cap, was a
    waterproof case used by soldiers. It was normally used to hold a
    document with name, blood type, and history of illness in case of
    injury. Others used it as a matchbox. Until his death, Shinji assumed
    his uncle kept that sort of thing in it too. But after he died, when
    he opened the tube, Shinji found something completely different
    inside. In fact the tube's casing itself was carved out of a special
    alloy and contained two smaller cylinders inside. Shinji took out the
    two cylinders. He had no idea what they were. The only thing he could
    tell was that their contents were supposed to be mixed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    thread of the screw from one of the cylinders fit perfectly into the
    other one. The reason why they were kept apart was that it was risky
    to connect them. And once he found out what they were for, after some
    research (no wonder they were separate—otherwise, you couldn't
    carry those cases around), he still had no idea why his uncle carried
    this around wherever he went. It served no particular purpose. Or
    maybe like the earring Shinji wore, his uncle had merely held onto it
    to remind himself of someone. Anyway, it was another piece of
    evidence from his uncle's past for Shinji to ponder over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    turned the squeaky cap and opened it. He hadn't opened it since his
    uncle died. He dropped the two cylinders into the palm of his hand.
    Then he opened the seal of the smaller cylinder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    had been stuffed with cotton to make it shockproof. There was the
    dull yellow of brass underneath the cotton.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    examining it, he returned both cylinders back into the larger
    container and screwed the cap back on. He'd thought that if he ever
    had to use this, it would be after they escaped the island, or after
    messing up the school computer. It might have been handy after they
    equipped themselves and attacked Sakamochi and the others—but now
    this was all they had.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    flipped out the blade from his pocketknife. The sun had moved west,
    and the bushes reflecting against the silver steel were dark yellow.
    Then he pulled out a pencil from his school coat pocket. It was the
    pencil they all used to write the phrase, &quot;We will kill,&quot;
    before the game began. Because he'd used it to mark the forbidden
    zones and check off the names of dead classmates, its point was now
    blunt. Shinji sharpened the pencil with his knife. Then he pulled out
    his map from another pocket and turned it over. It was blank.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yutaka.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    had been hugging his knees and gazing at the ground. He looked up.
    His eyes were shining. &quot;Did you come up with something?&quot; he
    asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    wasn't exactly sure why Yutaka's response ticked him off. It might
    have been the tone of his voice, or maybe the words. Shinji felt like
    saying, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>what
    the hell—here I am banging my head against the wall trying to come
    up with an escape plan and all you've been doing is sitting on your
    ass! You swore you were going to get back at them for Izumi Kanai,
    but you haven't done squat. You think this is a fast food restaurant
    where I'm working the register? You want some fries with that?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shinji restrained himself.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka's
    round cheeks were sunken and his cheekbones stuck out. It was only
    natural. He must have&nbsp;been worn out by the pressure of this game
    that could end at any moment for them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ever
    since he was a kid Shinji was always the best athlete in the class.
    (Although this changed in his second year in junior high, when he was
    joined by Shuya Nanahara and Kazuo Kiriyama. He could beat them in
    basketball, but he wasn't sure about other sports.) His uncle had
    taken him mountain climbing ever since he was a kid, and he was
    confident in any competition that required stamina. But not everyone
    was built like The Third Man. Yutaka was a poor athlete, and when the
    cold season came he was often absent. Fatigue must have been
    overwhelming him, and it might be numbing his thinking too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when Shinji realized something important. Wasn't the fact that he
    was even a little upset at Yutaka an indication of his own fatigue?
    Of course, given how their chances of survival were close to nil, it
    would have been much stranger not to be worn out.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    get it,&quot; Shinji stopped him and approached Yutaka. He fixed his

    something else.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    it's moved,&quot; he said and got behind him. Shinji examined his
    neck again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Did
    you get it?&quot;</font></font></p>

    look.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he lightly brushed away the nape of Yutaka's neck. He crushed the
    imaginary bug with the sole of his sneakers and (pretending) he
    picked it up and (pretending once again) tossed it out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    waved his index finger to get his attention and scribbled on the back

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    released his hand and said, &quot;I just know. I know a lot about

    now that the computer's failed, there's nothing we can do,&quot;

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    took out his pencil from his pocket and wrote under Shinji's scrawled

    Yutaka's eyes widened as he nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    then scribbled again: </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>I

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    poked Yutaka's shoulder with the index finger of his left hand and
    smiled at him. Then he scribbled: </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>Don't

    the southern side of the northern mountain, a boy sat on a spot on a
    slope covered with thick vegetation. He was looking at himself with a
    mirror he held in his left hand, neatly arranging his pompadour with
    the comb in his right. Ever since the game began he might have been
    the only student in&nbsp;class, including the girls, who felt like he
    could afford to take good care of his hair. But that was only
    natural. Although he had a thuggish-looking face, he paid an
    inordinate amount of attention to his personal appearance, and
    although no one knew exactly why, this boy was known, or no, had been
    known until now as &quot;Zulu,&quot; he was in any case...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Queer.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    for his location, he was at a horizontal distance directly two
    hundred meters west of where Shinji Mimura and Yutaka Seto were
    hiding. He was also approximately six hundred meters northwest of the
    medical facility where Shuya's trio was. In other words, he was right
    above the farmhouse where Shuya Nanahara had witnessed Kaori Minami
    get shot by Hirono Shimizu. If he looked up he would have had a clear
    view of the platform where the bodies of Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko
    Kitano were still lying, bathed in the light of the setting sun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    student arranging his hair had seen the corpses of Yumiko Kusaka,
    Yukiko Kitano, as well as that of Kaori Minami. He had actually seen
    more. Kaori Minami's was the seventh corpse he'd seen.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    the pinky of his right hand, the boy brushed the blade of grass from
    his hair and then looked beyond his own face in the mirror to the
    woods approximately twenty meters below him.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Aren't

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes,
    this queer boy who was holding a mirror and comb was the only member
    of the &quot;Kiriyama family&quot; who'd escaped Kazuo's massacre by
    not showing up at the assigned meeting place. And now he, Sho
    Tsukioka (Male Student No. 14), was the only surviving member of the
    Kiriyama family. In the shrubbery was Kazuo Kiriyama himself, who'd
    already finished off six students. For the last two hours Kazuo had
    remained still, though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    looked back at himself in the mirror, this time checking his
    complexion as he recalled how Mitsuru would always warn him against
    referring to Kazuo as &quot;Kazuo-kun.&quot; Mitsuru would say
    something like, &quot;Hey Sho, you have to call the boss, boss.&quot;
    But even bold Mitsuru seemed to have a hard time with a &quot;feminine
    guy,&quot; so as soon as Sho would respond with a casual sidelong
    glance, saying, &quot;Oh, give me a break. Don't be so picky, it's
    not very manly,&quot; and Mitsuru would just grimace, mumbling and
    letting it go at that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Call
    him boss, huh?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Sho thought as he looked over each of his eyes in the mirror. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But
    you ended up getting killed by that so-called boss. You're a fool.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was true. Sho Tsukioka had been more cautious than Mitsuru. It wasn't
    as if he had a clear sense of Kazuo the way Mitsuru had imagined
    right before his death, but Sho had always held the basic belief that
    betrayals happen all the time. That's how the world is. One could say
    that, compared to Mitsuru, who was just a good fighter, Sho, who'd
    seen more of the adult world as a result of going in and out of the
    gay bar his father ran ever since he was a kid, was more
    sophisticated.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Instead
    of heading straight to the southern tip of the island, as Kazuo had
    requested, Sho moved inward from the coast, weaving his way through
    the woods. This ended up being a hassle, but it probably only&nbsp;cost
    him ten more minutes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    ended up seeing it all from the woods along the beach. Three bodies,
    two wearing coats and one in her sailor suit, sprawled on the rock
    stretching out into the ocean across the beach. There was Kazuo
    Kiriyama, standing quietly in the crevice of the rock, hidden in
    shadows from the moonlight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuru
    Numai appeared almost immediately. After a brief exchange, he was
    pummeled by machine gun bullets and left on the rock that was
    drenched with blood now (its stench even reached Sho)....</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    my</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Sho thought. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>This
    is trouble.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    the time he began following Kazuo Kiriyama walking away from the
    scene, Sho had already decided on his course of action.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To
    assist him in this course of action, the top candidate was
    undoubtedly Kazuo Kiriyama. He couldn't hear what Kazuo and Mitsuru
    were saying to each other, but given how Kazuo had decided to play
    the game, he was sure Kazuo would be the best. Furthermore, at the
    very least, Kazuo carried not only a machine gun (was that his
    supplied weapon or did it belong to one of the three students he had
    killed?) but also Mitsuru's pistol. No one could win in a direct
    confrontation with Kazuo now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    had one advantage though, something he knew he was extremely good at.
    He had a talent for sneaking into places and stealing when no one was
    looking and was also good at following people. (When he found a boy
    he liked, he could stalk him endlessly.) A talent to be sneaky—</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>what
    do you mean sneaky, how dare you?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">—in
    all respects. As for the weapon he found in his day pack, it was a
    Derringer .22 Double High Standard. The cartridge was a magnum,
    lethal at close range, but not the best gun for a shootout.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>So</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Sho thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>even
    if Kazuo Kiriyama was going to emerge victorious, he'd have to take
    on tough guys like Shogo Kawada and Shinji Mimura (definitely my
    type) who, if they had guns, would probably end up injuring him. And
    all that fighting should wear him out.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Then
    I'll just follow him until the end. At the very end I can just shoot
    him from behind. The moment he thinks he's finished off the last one,
    he'll let his guard down and that's when I'll shoot him. Even Kazuo
    would never suspect someone would be following him, especially me,
    since I blew him off last night.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    way Sho wouldn't have to sully his hands in this game where you had
    to kill your classmates off one by one. It wasn't that he felt a
    strong moral objection to killing them, it was just that, he thought,
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    don't want to kill innocent kids—it's so vulgar. Kazuo's going to
    do the killing. I'm just going to stay behind him. He might be
    killing someone right in front of me, but it's not like I can
    interfere, that's too dangerous. And so at the very end, I'm going to
    kill him out of self-defense. I mean, if I don't kill him, he'll kill
    me. That was his line of thinking.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was another advantage he had in following Kazuo. If he stayed close
    to Kazuo, then he wouldn't have to worry much about being attacked.
    And on the off chance that he was, as long as he dodged the first
    attack Kazuo would have to respond. All Sho would have to do is flee
    the scene and Kazuo would take care of the rest. Of course, that
    would also mean losing track of Kazuo, bringing his plan to an end,
    so he wanted to avoid this scenario as much as possible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    decided to maintain a basic distance of twenty meters behind Kazuo.
    He'd move forward when Kazuo did and stop when Kazuo stopped. There
    was also the issue of the forbidden zones. Kazuo must have also been
    considering it, so he'd probably keep a good distance away from the
    zones. As long as Sho maintained his distance, he should be safe from
    entering the zones. When Kazuo stopped, he'd check the map to make
    sure he wasn't in a forbidden zone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everything
    had proceeded according to plan.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    left the southern tip of the island and after entering several houses
    in the residential area (probably finding what he was looking for),
    he decided to head to the northern mountain for some reason and then
    sat down. In the morning, when he heard the distant gunfire, he
    looked over there, but decided not to move, perhaps because of the
    distance. But then a little while later when Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko
    Kitano began calling from the peak of the mountain with their
    megaphone he moved quickly and after making sure no one was
    responding to their call (now wasn't there another gunshot? Sho
    believed there was, urging Yumiko and Yukiko to hide. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Wow,
    how wonderful, so there's a real humanitarian out there.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    He was moved, but not enough to alter his plans) he shot them dead.
    Then he descended the northern slope. There was another distant
    gunshot, but he stayed put on this one too.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then,
    this just happened, just before 3 p.m. he began moving after hearing
    gunfire on this side of the mountain. But what he (and Sho) found at
    the source was the dead body of Kaori Minami, lying inside a farm
    equipment storage shack. Kazuo went down to check the body, probably
    to go through her belongings, but it looked like someone else had
    gotten there before them. Then he proceeded to move on—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>And
    now he's in the woods right under me.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo's
    plan seemed simple, at least for now. Once he knew where someone was,
    he'd go there and shoot away. Sho was exasperated by the merciless
    way he'd killed Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Kazuo,
    you have such a plain name but your actions are out of control. And
    yet my name sounds like a celebrity's, Sho Tsukioka, but I'm just a
    Plain Jane</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">),
    but it was pointless to fret over these details. For now he should be
    happy that Kazuo was completely clueless about his presence.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    appeared to be resting quietly. He might have been sleeping.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    the other hand Sho couldn't sleep at all, but he felt he was strong
    in that department as well. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Naturally.
    Girls had more stamina than guys. That's what I read in one of those
    popular books.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What
    turned out to be a real drag instead was that he was a heavy smoker.
    The smell of cigarette smoke, depending on the wind direction, would
    give him away to Kazuo. No, the sound of his electronic lighter
    flicking open could be even more fatal.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    pulled out his pack of imported Virginia Slims Menthol cigarettes (he
    liked the name, though of course it was hard to get them in this
    country, but there were places that carried them, and all he had to
    do was steal them. He had piles of boxes in his room—and carefully
    placed the thin cigarette between his lips. He caught a whiff of the
    faint smell of tobacco leaves and that unique menthol odor and felt
    mild relief from his withdrawal. He wanted to fill his lungs with
    smoke—but somehow managed to suppress the urge.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I

    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To
    distract himself, he lifted the mirror in his left hand and caught a
    view of his face with the cigarette in his mouth. He tilted his head
    slightly and examined his sidelong glance.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Out

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    quickly removed the cigarette from his mouth and put it into his
    pocket, along with his mirror. Then he gripped the Derringer and
    grabbed his day pack with his left hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    Kiriyama's slicked-back head appeared on the edge of the bushes. He
    looked to his left and right and then northward—directly to the
    left of Sho—up the slope.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the shade of the azalea tree covered in pink leaves, Sho raised his
    brow slightly.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What's

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    heard no gunfire. No strange noise at all. Was there something over
    there?&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    looked over there, but saw no movement.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    emerged from shrubs. He had his day pack on his left shoulder and the
    machine gun slung over his right shoulder with his hand on its grip.
    He began climbing the slope, weaving his way in between the trees. He
    quickly reached Sho's higher position and moved on up. Sho then stood
    up and began following him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not
    at all in keeping with his large frame, 117 centimeters tall, Sho
    moved gracefully, like a cat. He carefully maintained the twenty
    meters behind Kazuo's black school coat that intermittently flashed
    between the trees. Sho's confidence was justified when it came to
    this sort of thing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo's
    movement was also very precise and quick. He'd stop in the shade of a
    tree, check ahead, and where the vegetation got thick, would get on
    his knees and check underneath before proceeding. The only trouble
    being that...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>...your

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    must have covered a hundred meters. The observatory was on the top
    left. Kazuo stopped there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rows of trees in front of him were interrupted by a narrow, unpaved
    road. It was less than two meters wide, just wide enough for a car.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh...this
    was the path leading up to the peak. We crossed it right before we
    saw Kaori Minami's body</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Sho thought.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    Kazuo's right, where he was looking, there was a space with a bench
    and a beige prefab toilet. Maybe it was a resting area for climbers
    on the way to the peak.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    surveyed the area and then looked behind Sho, but Sho of course had
    hidden himself away in the shade. Kazuo stepped onto the path and ran
    up to the toilet. He opened the door and went in. He stuck his head
    out and looked around again before he closed the door. He left it
    slightly ajar, maybe just in case he had to escape if something
    happened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    my.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Sho brought his hand to his lips. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    my</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Sho remained crouched, trying hard not to burst into a fit of
    laughter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was true, since Sho had started following him, Kazuo hadn't gone to
    the bathroom even once. He might have used the toilet in one of the
    houses he entered before sunrise, but in any case, it'd be impossible
    to hold it an entire day, so Sho assumed he took care of business
    hidden in the bushes. (Anyway, that's what Sho did. It was a pain not
    to make any sound though.) But turned out he was wrong. After all,
    Kazuo Kiriyama came from a wealthy family. Maybe the thought of going
    anywhere besides a real toilet was out of the question. He must have
    remembered seeing this toilet when he passed through here a while
    ago. That's why he came back here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
    it, I'm sure. Even Kazuo Kiriyama has to pee. How cute.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was pissing against the bowl now. Sho could hear it splashing against
    the bowl. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Tee
    hee</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Once again Sho tried hard not to laugh.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he remembered something and flipped his wrist over to check his
    watch. They were near sector D-8, which Sakamochi had announced would
    turn into a forbidden zone at 5 p.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    elegant italic numerals on the women's watch indicated 4:57 p.m.
    (He'd set his watch to Sakamochi's announcement, so it was accurate.)
    Sho took out his map and examined the northern mountain area. The
    mountain road was only marked by a dotted line on the map, and the
    rest area and public toilet wasn't marked in or outside the lines
    marking off D=8.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    suddenly became tense and unconsciously lifted his hand up to his
    metallic collar. He suddenly felt the urge to return the way he'd
    come but—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked over at toilet, where the sprinkling sound continued. He
    shrugged and exhaled lightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>We're
    talking about Kazuo Kiriyama here, after all. Even if nature called,
    he would have checked his position. The reason why he cautiously
    looked over here before moving out of the bushes where he was hiding
    was to determine whether the toilet was in D-8 or not.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    And Sho's position was approximately thirty meters west of the
    toilet. Kazuo was closer to the zone than he was, so the fact that
    Kazuo was over there, in other words, meant that he was safe too. He
    mustn't lose Kazuo by succumbing to irrational fear. That would ruin
    his plan.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    pulled out the Virginia Slims he'd taken out a moment ago and put it
    between his lips. Then he looked at the dimming sky. At this time of
    year, it'd still be another two hours before sundown, but the
    darkening sky was now tinged with orange from the west, and the tips
    of several tiny clouds had become bright orange. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>It
    was beautiful. Just like me.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    sprinkling continued. Sho grinned again. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>You
    must have held it for a long time, Kazuo.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    still continued.</font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when Sho finally knit his drooping, thick brows. He took the
    cigarette out of his mouth and quickly got up. He approached the
    toilet, moving along the shrubs, and squinted his eyes</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just
    then a sudden wind blew by, opening the squeaky door. What brilliant
    timing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho's
    eyes opened wide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Inside
    the toilet a government-supplied water bottle was hanging from the
    ceiling as it swung in the wind. Kazuo had probably pierced it with a
    blade because there was a very thin stream of water trickling out,
    fluttering with the wind.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sho
    panicked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he saw the back of a school coat below, weaving its way through the

    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Kazuo disappeared beyond the shrubs, Sho heard a thud. It resembled
    the sound of a silencer, or a gunshot into a pillow. It was
    impossible to say whether the sound came from the bomb itself in the
    government's custom Program collar or from the vibration it made
    through his body.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    a brief stir Noriko opened her eyes. It was past 7 p.m. She gazed at
    the ceiling of the room, now turned dark. Then she looked at Shuya
    beside her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    got up a from his seat and removed the damp towel on her forehead. He
    touched it. Just as it was when he checked last time, her fever was
    almost gone. Shuya felt a wave of relief. Great. Really.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya.&quot;
    Noriko's voice was still dazed, &quot;What time is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    past seven. You slept well.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. &quot;Your fever's gone down. Shogo said it probably wasn't
    from septicemia. It was just a really bad cold. Probably from
    fatigue.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see.&quot; Noriko nodded slowly as if she were also relieved. Then
    she turned to Shuya. &quot;I'm sorry for all this trouble.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    are you talking about?&quot; Shuya shook his head. &quot;It's not
    your fault at all.&quot; Then he asked, &quot;Can you eat? We have
    rice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko's
    eyes opened wide. &quot;Rice?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    just hold on. Shogo cooked some.&quot; Shuya left the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    was sitting on the chair by the window by the kitchen door. The last
    traces of light—more like particles of blue, closer to
    indigo—entered the window, but where Shogo was sitting it was
    almost completely pitch black.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko's
    up?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    about her fever?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;She's
    fine. It seems to be gone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    gave him a slight nod, then stood up, holding the shotgun as usual.
    He opened the lid of the pot on the gas stove. Shuya and Shogo had
    already had their share of cooked rice and miso soup. The miso soup
    base came from some strange leaves growing in the back of the
    building.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Is
    the food cold?&quot; Shuya asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    gave him a brief reply, &quot;Wait five or ten minutes. I'll bring it
    over.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Thanks.&quot;
    Shuya returned to the examination room. He sat down by the bed and
    gave Noriko a small nod. &quot;Wait a little. Shogo's going to bring
    some real rice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded. Then she asked, &quot;Is there a bathroom here?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh,
    yeah. Over here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    helped Noriko out of the bed. Supporting her with his arm, he showed
    her to the bathroom beyond the waiting room. She was still
    staggering, but she'd definitely recovered from the terrible
    condition she was in before.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    helped Noriko return to her bed. As Noriko sat down on the edge of
    the bed, Shuya wrapped her shoulders with the blanket the way Ms.
    Anno had done for him at the Charity House when he was a kid.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Once
    you've eaten,&quot; Shuya said as he pulled at the edges of the
    blanket, &quot;I think you should get some more sleep. We're going to
    have to leave this place by 11 p.m.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    stared at Shuya. Her eyes still looked slightly unfocused. &quot;You
    mean—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. &quot;Yeah, this zone's going to be forbidden at eleven.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was part of the announcement Sakamochi gave at 6 p.m. Other zones
    included G-l at 7 p.m. and I-3 at 9 p.m. That meant the southwest
    border and the southern slope of the southern mountain. Since it was
    hard to tell exactly where the border of the forbidden zone was, the
    southwest shore area was all off limits now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked down at her kneecaps and touched her forehead under her bangs.
    &quot;I was sleeping like an idiot.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    reached out and touched Noriko on the shoulder. &quot;Don't be
    ridiculous. You were better off sleeping. You need to rest more. Take
    it easy.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Noriko glanced up and asked, &quot;Did anyone else— besides
    Kaori—die?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    tightened his lips. Then he nodded. &quot;Takako. And Sho and
    Kazushi.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	According
    to Sakamochi's announcement, these four had died during the six hours
    after twelve o'clock. Now there were only twenty-one students left.
    Only eighteen hours had passed since the game began, yet Third Year
    Class B of Shiroiwa Junior High had been reduced to half its size.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And
    one more thing,&quot; Sakamochi had said enthusiastically. &quot;Sho
    Tsukioka was caught in a forbidden zone. So I want you all to be
    careful.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    didn't say where Sho had died, and Shuya couldn't remember hearing a
    big explosion in the afternoon. At the same time he couldn't see any
    reason Sakamochi would lie. That big, boorish-looking guy who oddly
    enough acted really feminine, &quot;Zuki&quot; of the Kiriyama
    family, had gotten himself caught in a zone. As a result, his head
    was blown off. Besides their boss then, the entire Kiriyama family
    was&nbsp;decimated.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought of telling Noriko about this, but after seeing how troubled
    she looked, he decided not to. He doubted that sharing any news about
    a guy's head getting blown off would have a good effect on Noriko's
    recovery.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see...&quot; Noriko said quietly and then added, &quot;Thanks for
    this,&quot; and began taking off the coat she'd been wearing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Keep
    it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    I'm all right now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took the coat and draped the blanket over her shoulder again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    came in after a while. Like a waiter, he carried a round tray full of
    bowls on one hand. Steam rose from the bowls. As he lowered the tray
    he said, &quot;Here you are, madame.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    chuckled. &quot;So she gets room service?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    the food isn't exactly first class. I hope it tastes all right
    though.&quot; Shogo put the entire tray on the bed and placed the
    bowls next to her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked down and asked, &quot;Soup?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes
    ma'am,&quot; Shogo replied in English, which sounded pretty fluent to
    Shuya's ears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Thanks,&quot;
    Noriko said and took the spoon. She brought the bowl to her lips and
    swallowed a mouthful. &quot;It's delicious.&quot; She raised her
    voice. &quot;There's egg in it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then looked at Shogo. &quot;It's our special, ma'am.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Where'd
    you find that?&quot; Shuya asked. All the fresh food in the
    refrigerator was rotten, probably because the government had moved
    the civilians out a while ago. All the other houses were probably in
    the same condition.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Shuya out of the corner of his eye and grinned. &quot;I
    found a house that kept a hen. It looked like it hadn't been fed in a
    while and looked pretty weak.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    exaggeratedly shook his head. &quot;When we ate I didn't notice any
    eggs.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    lifted his brows. &quot;I only found one. Sorry. I'm nicer to girls.
    That's just how I am.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    laughed, sniggering.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    returned to the kitchen and brought over some tea. Shuya and Shogo
    drank tea while Noriko ate her meal. The tea had a mild sweetness and
    a pleasant, nostalgic odor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn,&quot;
    Shuya groaned. &quot;I feel like everything's fine, the three of us
    sitting around like this.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled and said, &quot;I'll make some coffee later. Would you prefer
    tea, Noriko?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    spoon still in her mouth, Noriko smiled and nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    Shogo.&quot; Shuya had more to say. Of course the fact was that they
    were still in this killing game, but now that Noriko seemed to be
    recovering, he was feeling a little gushy. &quot;Some day the three
    of us, let's all get together for some tea. We'll sit on the veranda
    and enjoy the cherry blossoms.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was highly unlikely. Nonetheless Shogo shrugged his shoulders and
    said, &quot;I thought you were a rocker. You sound like an old man.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know. You're not the first one to tell me that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    chuckled. Shuya laughed, and so did Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    finished her meal and said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Shogo gathered her
    bowls. He signaled with his other hand for Shuya's cup, which Shuya
    handed over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Noriko said, &quot;I feel totally fine now. Thank you so much. And
    I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled and replied, &quot;You're welcome,&quot; in English. &quot;But
    it looks like the antibiotic wasn't necessary.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.
    I know this sounds weird, but I think it made me feel secure enough
    to fall asleep.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled again and added, &quot;Well, you could still be suffering from
    septicemia. In any case, you should rest a little more. Take it
    easy.&quot; Shogo then said to Shuya, &quot;Do you mind if I catch
    some sleep?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. &quot;You tired?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    not really, but it's best to sleep when you can. Once we leave here,
    I'll stay up through the night. Is that all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah
    sure, that's fine.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded, took the tray, and headed towards the hall.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,
    you should sleep here,&quot; Noriko said, signaling towards the bed
    next to hers.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    glanced back at her from the door and smiled as if saying, no thank
    you. &quot;I don't want to intrude on you two. I'll sleep on the sofa
    in this room.&quot; He tilted his head in that direction and added,
    &quot;Please be considerate to your neighbors though if you get
    intimate.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the dim room Shuya could see Noriko's face flush.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    then left the room. Beyond the half opened door, Shuya heard him walk
    out of the kitchen and into the waiting room. It became quiet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    broke into a smile and said, &quot;Shogo's so funny.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Perhaps
    it was because of the meal, her face seemed more animated.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    he is,&quot; Shuya smiled too. &quot;I'd never talked to him until
    now, but he kind of reminds me of Shinji.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    didn't resemble each other at all physically, but Shogo's crude and
    blunt speech and his ability to still be humorous through it all
    resembled The Third Man. Not to mention the way he was the anti-model
    student and yet managed to be incredibly smart and reliable.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded. &quot;You know you're right. Totally.&quot; Then Noriko
    uttered, &quot;I wonder where Shinji is.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath. He'd been wondering whether there was any way to
    contact him, but given Noriko's condition he couldn't afford to do
    anything.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    if he were only with us...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    Shinji along and with Shogo on their side, Shuya thought they
    couldn't be defeated. And if Hiroki Sugimura were with them they
    would be fearless and invincible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    still remember the class match,&quot; Noriko said as she glanced up
    at the ceiling. &quot;Not this year's, but last year's. The finals.
    Shinji was on his own against Class D, who had four students on the
    basketball team. We were thirty points behind, but then you rushed
    over after your softball game, and together you two guys started an
    incredible comeback.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;
    Shuya nodded. He noticed how Noriko was becoming talkative. That was
    a good sign. &quot;I guess that's what happened.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    was cheering you guys on. When we won Yukie was on her feet
    shrieking.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    remembered too. Because Noriko, who was always reserved, was cheering
    the loudest. And although he wasn't as uncoordinated as Yoshio
    Akamatsu, the unathletic Yoshitoki Kuninobu was standing apart from
    Noriko and the others. Shuya saw Yoshitoki, his hands waving and
    making devil signs. It was a humble gesture, but Yoshitoki's display
    of support moved Shuya more than Noriko and the other girls'
    screaming rally.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    gazed back at Noriko, and then realized that Noriko was crying. He
    reached over to Noriko, touching her shoulder, and asked, &quot;What's
    wrong?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh,&quot;
    Noriko hiccuped slightly. &quot;I was telling myself not to cry,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. It might have been from the still lingering fever, or it
    might have been from the drugs, but Noriko seemed to be in an
    emotional state. He kept his hand on her shoulder until she stopped
    crying.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Eventually
    Noriko said, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; and wiped her eyes. Then she

    you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;
    Noriko looked away from Shuya and nodded. &quot;It's easy to tell
    with girls. I just...wanted you to have fond thoughts for them.&quot;
    She added, &quot;I am in no position to be telling you this now,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had a dim image of the faces of Megumi Eto and Yukiko Kitano. Just a
    little though. Like, two teaspoons each. &quot;Wow.&quot; He exhaled.

    to survive together.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    it was Noriko's turn to open her eyes wide. &quot;Really? Why me?&quot;
    She said this innocently, but the expression on her face vanished
    quickly. Shuya saw the fading light from the window reflected as an
    obscure rectangle in her pupils. She asked, &quot;Is he a classmate?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    slowly shook his head. As he recalled those warm eyes, he thought,

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked somewhat relieved as she looked down at the knees of her skirt
    and only mumbled, &quot;I see.&quot; Then she looked up and said, &quot;So
    who could it be? I wasn't in any clubs or teams. And I don't have
    friends in any of the other classes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head. &quot;I'm not telling. I'll tell you once we're out
    of here.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    they fell silent for a while Shuya looked up at the ceiling. Even
    though tidiness was mandatory in a clinic, the fluorescent light
    hanging here had dusty covers. The lights didn't work. They couldn't
    turn them on anyway even if they did.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Megumi-san—&quot;

    have possibly liked about me?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It

    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    chuckled and shook his head, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    what it means to love someone.&quot; Noriko's suddenly sounded
    serious. &quot;Isn't that how you feel about that girl?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought of Kazumi Shintani's face. He thought about it. He hesitated,
    but thought he should be honest. &quot;Yeah. Something like that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;If
    it's not, then it's not real,&quot; Noriko said as if she were amused
    and then let out a quiet laugh.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    jealous. Even in this situation, it's still hard.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at her face—it&nbsp;was no longer discernible in the
    dark—and hesitated whether he should tell her, but then decided he
    should be honest with her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    can relate to the guy who had a crush on you though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked up at Shuya. Her well-defined brows seemed to quiver slightly.

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You're
    so wonderful,&quot; Shuya said.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    opened his eyes wide as if asking, &quot;What is it?&quot; but he
    wasn't sure whether Noriko could see his reaction. Noriko then leaned
    over slightly and gently put both of her hands on Shuya's upper arms,
    putting her head against his shoulder. Her shoulder-length short hair
    brushed up against Shuya's cheeks and ears.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    the dusk turned to darkness, Hirono Shimizu (Female Student No. 10)
    emerged from the thicket she'd been hiding in and proceeded west. It
    was unbearable. Her body was on fire as if she were walking in a
    desert under a burning sun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Water.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    needed water.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    Minami had shot her in the upper left arm. After tearing open the
    sleeve of her sailor suit drenched in blood, she discovered the
    bullet had penetrated her arm. The skin on the exit wound was torn up</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	badly.
    It seemed the bullet had barely missed the major blood vessels. The
    torn sleeve she wrapped around her arm as a bandage seemed to have
    stopped the bleeding for a while. But then...the wound started to
    burn and the sensation spread all over her body. The initial chill
    was replaced by a numbing heat. By the time Sakamochi made his
    announcement at 6 p.m. Hirono had finished off her entire supply of
    water. After she killed Kaori she ran approximately two hundred
    meters away from Shuya and hid in the thicket, but she ended up using
    a lot of water in her attempt to clean her wound (which she ended up
    deeply regretting).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Almost
    two hours had passed since then. For a while she'd been sweating
    profusely underneath her uniform, but now she wasn't sweating at all.
    Most likely she was approaching dehydration. In other words, unlike
    Noriko Nakagawa, Hirono was actually suffering from septicemia. And
    because she hadn't disinfected her wound, it came on quickly. Of
    course she had no way of knowing any of this.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    only thing she knew was that she needed water.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she cautiously moved through the green woods of the mountain,
    Hirono's head spun with thoughts of hatred towards Kaori Minami. Her
    burning body and thirst only intensified these thoughts.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    Shimizu had no intention of trusting anyone in this game. Of course
    she'd been tight with Mitsuko Souma forever, and according to student
    number she immediately preceded Mitsuko. So if she'd managed to avoid
    Hiroki Sugimura, who came in between their departures, she could have
    met up with Mitsuko, but she chose not to. Because she knew how
    terrifying Mitsuko really was. Like when Mitsuko took on a bad-girl
    leader from another school (who'd by then become the mistress of a
    yakuza gangster). That girl ended up getting run over by a car. The
    injury was nearly fatal. Mitsuko didn't say anything about it, but
    Hirono knew Mitsuko had some guy do it. There were plenty of guys
    willing to do anything for Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If
    Hirono had decided to meet up with Mitsuko, Mitsuko would have
    probably used her as much as possible only to finally shoot her in
    the back. Even though she was part of the group too, the somewhat
    clueless Yoshimi Yahagi might trust Mitsuko (which reminded her of
    how Yoshimi was dead, and Hirono had a hunch that Mitsuko was the one
    who killed her), but Hirono was having none of that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    couldn't imagine trusting anyone else in her class. The ones who
    acted nice were the ones that wouldn't think twice about killing the
    others now. She might have only been fifteen years old, but those
    fifteen years had taught her that much.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    the same time though she wasn't too thrilled about killing off her
    classmates. She'd done prostitution and drugs, and she constantly
    fought with her parents who treated her like a lost cause, but murder
    was taboo. Of course the rules of the game permitted it, so it wasn't
    a crime here—but while she'd done some bad things, they were never
    all that harmful towards others. Even though she'd prostituted
    herself, compared to other girls who pretended to be proper at the
    same time that they &quot;phone-dated&quot; (she knew Mayumi Tendo
    was one of those), at least she went the whole nine yards working
    with professionals through her connection with Mitsuko Souma. As for
    drugs, what was wrong with asserting her individual freedom to
    choose? And it wasn't like she was putting the mall's cosmetics
    department out of business by stealing stuff from there. They have
    huge capital backing anyway. Yes, she bullied others around, but they
    deserved it. And as far as her fights with students from other
    schools, they all knew they were out to hurt each other and what they
    were in for. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    mean, come on, grow up</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    In any case, she was&nbsp;not the kind of girl who'd go around
    murdering people. She knew that much.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But,
    but...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	...it
    was different if she had to defend herself. And if she ended up
    surviving in this game, then she'd&nbsp;open a bottle of champagne to
    celebrate. Or if time ran out and she died—her thoughts weren't
    very clear on this matter. Anyway there was nothing she could do
    about that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    she ended up hiding out in that house where she later had that
    shootout with Kaori Minami.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    she'd checked it out and saw no one was there, she stayed there.
    Occasionally she'd look out the window, and once, much to her dismay,
    she caught a glimpse of someone in the shack across from the building
    where she was staying.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    several minutes she decided to leave the house (she was good at
    leaving home). She couldn't stand the thought of someone being near
    her. There was no back entrance, so she climbed out the window
    furthest from the shack when it happened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaori
    was looking out the door of the shack. She suddenly fired at Hirono,
    who'd done nothing. Kaori's shot hit Hirono's arm, and Hirono nearly
    rolled outside onto the ground. She somehow managed to get on her
    feet, and for the first time aimed her pistol and fired back. Then as
    she remained glued to the wall of the edge of the house. That was
    when Shuya Nanahara appeared.</font></font></p>

    The jury's verdict would have been 12-0, no prob.) And if the others
    are anything like her then I'll have to be merciless, I think.</i></font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ridiculous.
    Nothing could be more risky than being with someone under these
    circumstances. If you're in a group, well then, that's just your own

    escape anyway.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    didn't see Noriko Nakagawa, but if he was telling her the truth, then
    Shuya Nanahara would soon be killing Noriko Nakagawa. Or perhaps
    Noriko Nakagawa would be killing Shuya Nanahara. If one of them ended
    up surviving then Hirono might end up having to kill one of them. But

    she knew it she had covered a fair distance. The dim sunlight in the
    western sky was gone. The sky up above was now jet black and the full
    moon just like last night when the game began shone eerily, casting a
    pale blue light on this island.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    held onto the revolver that had killed Kaori Minami, a Smith &amp;
    Wesson Military &amp; Police .38, and ran through the bushes. She
    held her head low with bated breath. Then she slowly peered out of
    the bushes. There was a house standing beyond a narrow farm. Hirono
    was near the northern mountain. There was a foothill on the other
    side of the house. On the left there were several farms and further
    beyond two more similar houses. Then the land sloped upward to the
    southern mountain. According to the map, in front of that mountain
    there was supposed to be a relatively wide longitudinal road that
    traversed the island. So given the position of the mountains Hirono
    was probably near the island's&nbsp;western shore. Just as she had
    done before moving, she checked her position and was pretty certain
    she wasn't in a forbidden zone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    did her best to forget about her thirst and observed the house in
    front. The area was completely still and silent.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    remained crouched and crossed the farm. The area around the house
    seemed slightly elevated above the farm. Hirono stopped at the edge
    of the farm and after looking back she observed the house again. It
    was your average, old, single-story farmhouse. But unlike the
    previous house she'd hid inside, the roof was tiled. An unpaved road
    came in from the left side of the farm. There was a light truck
    parked in front of the house. She also saw a moped and bicycle.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    water at the first house Hirono hid in wasn't running. This one was
    probably no different. Hirono looked to her right and left&nbsp;and
    found a well at the far end of the area from the entrance road. It
    even had a beam holding a bucket. There were thin tangerine trees
    with plenty of leaves surrounding the well. Their branches were high,
    so she could tell there was no one hiding under the trees.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since
    she couldn't use her left hand, she tucked her gun in the front. Then
    she groped around the farm soil under the moonlight. She found a
    fist-sized rock.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    tossed it upward. Tracing an arc, the rock crashed against the roof.
    It rattled down the rows of tiles and fell off the edge onto the
    ground with a thud.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    gripped the gun and waited. She checked her watch. Then she waited
    again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Five
    minutes passed. No one appeared at the windows or entrance. Hirono
    quickly stepped up to the property and ran toward the well. Her head
    was spinning from thirst and fever.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    well was a concrete tube approximately eighty centimeters high.
    Hirono clutched the brim of the well.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Inside
    it, the moonlight revealed a small circle six to seven meters down.
    Her own shadow was also reflected inside the circle.&nbsp;It was
    water.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Ah,
    it wasn't dry.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    again Hirono tucked her revolver into her skirt and removed her day
    pack from her aching left shoulder with her right hand. It landed on
    the dirt. Then she held the worn out rope hanging from the bucket
    beam.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she pulled the rope, a small bucket appeared on the surface of the
    water. Hirono frantically tugged at the rope. The bucket beam was
    equipped with what looked like an ancient pulley which allowed you to
    retrieve water with two buckets. Her left arm was too numb to move,
    but with every pull she held the rope against the concrete edge of
    the well with her elbow and managed to pull the bucket upward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    bucket finally reached the edge of the well. She held the rope with
    her elbow once more, grabbed the handle of the bucket, and placed it
    on the edge of the well. It was water. The bucket was brimming with
    water. She didn't care if it ended up making her sick. Her body
    needed water now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then she discovered something and let out a small shriek.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a tiny fingernail-sized frog swimming in the water. In the
    moonlight she saw its small, gross&nbsp;eyes and its glistening back.
    (In broad daylight, their color would have been an disgusting
    fluorescent green, or a dirty brown.) It was her least favorite
    animal, and the mere sight of one with its slimy skin was enough to
    send chills down her spine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    did her best to quell her disgust. She didn't have the strength to
    pull the bucket up again. Her thirst was unbearable now. She would
    have to get rid of that frog, and then—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    frog climbed onto the edge of the bucket and leapt onto Hirono.
    Hirono let out a small shriek and twisted her body. So what if this
    was a matter of life or death. She just couldn't stand frogs. She
    somehow managed to dodge the frog—but her right hand let go of the
    bucket, which suddenly fell back into the well with a splash—and
    that was that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    groaned and looked over in the direction of the frog. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'll
    kill it. I'll kill that fucking frog!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    something else caught her eye.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    saw a black figure in a student coat stop a mere four or five meters
    in front of her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono's
    back had been facing the house. Now she saw the back door behind the
    figure was ajar.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    the figure frozen in its footsteps, Hirono suddenly recalled a
    childhood memory—the game where you have to freeze when the person
    who was &quot;it&quot; turns around—but that was irrelevant. The
    issue at stake was that this thin, short, ugly boy—come to think of
    it, he also resembled a frog—Toshinori Oda (Male Student No. 4) was
    holding a thin, ribbonlike object with both hands. Hirono realized it
    was a belt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    look at this. Toshinori Oda, the privileged son of a company
    president whose house was located in the town's wealthy district. He
    was supposed to be good at violin (apparently he'd won some
    competition). A pretentious, well bred, quiet boy. And this kid was
    now...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>...trying
    to kill me!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if the pause on a frozen video image had been suddenly released,
    Toshinori moved, swung his belt up, and attacked her. The large
    buckle sparkled in the moonlight. It could easily gouge out some
    flesh on impact. The distance between them was only four meters.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Enough.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono's
    right hand went for her gun. She felt the grip, by now a familiar
    sensation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    was right in front of her. She fired. She fired three times in a row.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    the shots landed in his stomach. She saw his school coat
    instantaneously rip apart.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    spun around and fell face forward. Dust flew up into the air and he
    remained motionless.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    tucked the revolver into her skirt again. The hot barrel burned
    against her stomach, but she couldn't be concerned about that. Right
    now the important thing was water.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    picked up her day pack and entered the house. She'd been foolish
    exposing her back to the house, but now she no longer had to make
    sure it was unoccupied. And she could drink Toshinori's water.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    deliberated over whether to use her flashlight, but Toshinori's day
    pack turned out to be located right behind the back door. Hirono
    crouched down and opened the zipper with her right hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    were water bottles. One of them hadn't been opened and the other was
    still half full. She felt a&nbsp;wave of relief.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    on her knees, Hirono opened the lid of the half filled bottle and
    pressed her lips against it, sucking on it as she tilted the bottle
    back. Hmm. Was this an indirect kiss with the boy who had tried to
    kill her—who was, on top of that, dead? Didn't matter. Concerns
    like that were now as remote as the tropics or the north pole. Or the
    moon. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>This
    is Armstrong. One small step for a man...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    guzzled the water down. It was delicious. No doubt about that. Water
    never tasted this good. Even though the water was lukewarm, as it
    gushed down her throat and into her stomach it felt like ice water.
    It was so good.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    emptied the bottle almost immediately. She took a deep breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    wrapped around her throat. Right above the metal collar. She went
    into a coughing fit and a mist of water sprayed out between her lips.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she struggled with her functioning right hand to free herself from
    the object digging in under her throat, she twisted her head around.
    Immediately to the right of her face she saw the boy's tense
    face...which belonged to Toshinori Oda, the boy who just died!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    throat was getting choked. It took her several seconds to realize
    what was wrapped around her neck. It was Toshinori's belt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    how how how could this guy be alive?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    dark interior of the house was fading into red. She tried to pry the
    belt loose with her right hand as her fingernails tore off. Blood
    dripped out of her fingers.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
    right, my gun.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirono
    reached for her gun tucked in the front of her skirt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    her arm was kicked by the foot of an expensive leather shoe, making a
    cracking sound. Along with her left arm, her right one went numb too.
    The belt slackened for a moment—but then it tightened again. She
    couldn't hold the belt anymore and instead she swung her twisted arm
    around in a bizarre looking manner.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was only a matter of seconds. Her arm hung limply. Although she
    wasn't in the same rank as Takako Chigusa or Mitsuko Souma, she was
    still quite attractive and she had the appealing, mature look of a
    high school or college student. But now her face was puffed up from
    blood congestion, and her tongue was now twice its normal size and
    hung out from the middle of her mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nonetheless,
    Toshinori Oda continued choking Hirono's throat. (Of course he didn't
    forget to check around occasionally.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    five minutes or so, Toshinori finally released the belt from Hirono's
    neck. The breathless Hirono fell forward onto the raised floor. There
    was a muffled cracking sound. Maybe part of Hirono's face had
    cracked. Her punkish hair that stood straight up was now going in all
    directions and fading into the darkness. The nape of her neck above
    the collar of her sailor suit and her left arm with the torn sleeve
    were the only parts glimmering white.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    Oda breathed heavily for a while as he stood still in a daze. His
    stomach was still in pain, but it wasn't too bad now. When he first
    opened his day pack he had no idea what this cumbersome strange gray
    vest was, but it did exactly what the manual said it would.
    Amazing&nbsp;what a bulletproof vest can do.</font></font></p>

    area was pitch black by now, but thanks to the nearly full moon, the
    cliff extending from the foot of the northern mountain offered a wide
    open view of the ocean. The Seto Inland Sea Islands floated in the
    black sea, but there were absolutely no ship lights nearby due to the
    governments prohibition on traffic in the area. The guard ships were
    also out of sight, probably because they were moored with their
    lights off.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    seen this view before, but from a lower position, when he left the
    school building. Of course, this was neither the time nor place to
    call it a nice view.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right then, over here,&quot; Shinji said. He tucked his gun into his
    belt, and was the first to climb up on the rock. Then he offered his
    hand to Yutaka. Yutaka was out of breath due to the climb up the
    mountain as well as from the looming threat of being attacked in the
    dark, but he managed to grip onto Shinji's hand and struggled up the
    rock.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    stayed flat on their stomachs and looked down the cliff.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    blackened rows of woods spread out beneath them, and further beyond
    there was a glimmer of light. It came from the school building where
    Sakamochi was. It hardly emitted any light because the windows had
    been sealed off with those steel sheets. It was approximately one
    hundred meters away. The school's sector, G-7, was already forbidden,
    so they'd immediately get killed if they entered it, but they were a
    safe distance away now. By using cross-bearing navigation with his
    compass and map before the sun went down, Shinji managed to figure
    out precisely the zone layout. The school, in sector G-7, was nearer
    the border of F-7, where Shinji and Yutaka were now, and according to
    the map the shortest distance to the border was approximately eighty
    meters. Furthermore, with the 6 p.m. announcement of forbidden zones,
    neither F-7 nor H-7, which surrounded the school, were included.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    reminded him of Sakamochi's announcement that Sho Tsukioka had gotten
    caught in a forbidden zone. He was an annoying, queer kid (&quot;Shinji,
    let's go out on a date&quot;), and right now Shinji really couldn't
    be bothered by others, but he felt a little sorry for Sho whose head
    had probably been blown off by a bomb. He wondered where it happened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    also felt a pang of remorse over the death of Takako Chigusa. She was
    the prettiest girl in the class (according to Shinji's taste,
    anyway), and what's more, she was childhood friends with Hiroki
    Sugimura. Contrary to what most of the class thought—that they were
    a couple—Hiroki and Takako weren't going out (Hiroki himself told
    Shinji). Still, it must have come as a shock to Hiroki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hiroki—where

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    decided to concentrate on the present. He observed the school below
    and its surrounding geography closely. They would have to stretch a
    rope from here, over the school, and then over to the other side of
    the zone. Now that he actually had a view of the area, he realized
    how much distance they'd have to cover.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gazing
    at the gentle light leaking out the steel-plated windows, Shinji
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>damn</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    That was where Sakamochi and his men were. It was dinner time. For
    all he knew they could be eating fried udon. (He thought of fried
    udon because it was his favorite ever since his uncle made it several
    times for him when he had him over at his small single-bedroom house
    and that was what Shinji wanted so badly to eat right now.) Bastards.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    and Yutaka already had what they needed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    it wasn't indicated on the map (which marked it as just another blue
    dot), Shinji managed to find a farm coop near the longitudinal road
    slightly south of the school. The building with slated roof and walls
    bore a sign that read&nbsp;&quot;Northern Takamatsu Agricultural
    Cooperative Association, Okishima Island Branch.&quot; (Although
    Shinji already knew they were on Okishima Island in the Takamatsu-shi
    Sound, Yutaka was impressed.) It wasn't your typical farm coop. It
    had no real office, nor were there any ATMs. There was only a
    tractor, combine harvester, and threshing machine scattered inside
    the warehouse-like space. The only other equipment they found was an
    office desk taking up one of the corners. Anyway, that was where they
    found the ammonium nitrate. Fortunately it was fresh, not at all
    damp. On top of that, they didn't have to collect gas from cars. They
    found plenty in the gas containers.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    pulley they took from the well next to the house where Shinji had
    found the Macintosh PowerBook 150, slightly east of the coop.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    other significant item was rope. If they were going to stretch rope
    across sector G-7 they would need at least three hundred meters of
    it. Furthermore, they would have to roll it out with plenty of slack
    to escape detection by Sakamochi and his men so they needed even
    more. It wasn't going to be easy finding rope that long. The farm
    coop had rope but all together it was at most two hundred meters long
    and—maybe it was used for a greenhouse or something—too thin at a
    diameter of less than three millimeters to be reliable.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fortunately
    though, they managed to find what appeared to be a private
    fishing-equipment warehouse along the shore south from the harbor,
    which was now forbidden along with the residential area. In spite of
    the fishing rope being weathered out from exposure, in spite of its
    heavy weight and size, given how it was over three hundred meters
    long, Shinji and Yutaka managed to divide it up, transport it, and
    hide it in the farm coop.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Leaving
    these resources behind, they came up here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stared into the dark. The foot of the northern mountain, where they
    were now, spread out around this side of the school, in other words,
    the north side, and his right, the west side. To the left of the
    school, the woods on the east extended up to the northern side of the
    residential area and the seashore. Beyond the school there were paddy
    fields. There were clusters of trees here and there, and between them
    he could see some houses. Beyond the houses, Shinji could barely make
    out the farm coop warehouse where they had left all their equipment.
    Immediately to the left the area became gradually crowded with rows
    of roofs that extended over the border of the forbidden zone into the
    residential area.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    tapped him on the shoulder. Shinji looked to Yutaka, who was on his
    right. Yutaka pulled out his student notepad and began writing
    something.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    they started moving, Shinji had warned Yutaka with another message
    that they mustn't give anything away by talking. After all, if
    Sakamochi and his men found out they were up to no good again, this
    time Shinji was sure they wouldn't hesitate to blow their heads off
    by remote control.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    already gone over why Sakamochi chose not to ignite Shinji and
    Yutaka's collars. It was probably because it was best for the game </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>if
    the students fought each other as much as possible</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Shinji had some theories about this. It had to do with a rumor he'd
    heard that high-ranking government officials placed bets on this
    game. If that was true, then he was sure the star shooting guard of
    Shiroiwa Junior High, The Third Man, must have been the top seed. All
    the more reason why Sakamochi couldn't just finish him off. That was
    Shinji's hypothesis. Meanwhile Yoshitoki Kuninobu and Fumiyo
    Fujiyoshi were&nbsp;irrelevant players. Or, to be blunt, no one had
    placed any bets on them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still,
    even if that were true (what a bastard that &quot;Kinpati Sakamocho&quot;
    was), as long as Sakamochi was in charge of this game, he could blow
    their heads off at any time. Shinji could only pray that wouldn't
    happen until they managed to bomb the school. Of course Shinji found
    the idea despicable. The thought of someone else having so much
    control over him was entirely revolting to Shinji, who learned from
    his uncle how to be totally self-reliant for everything in his life.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he looked down at the light from the school though, he shook his
    head. That was neither here nor there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    recalled his uncle once telling him, &quot;Don't worry about stuff
    you can't do anything about. You do what you can even if your chances
    of success are less than one percent.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    seemed done writing his message and tapped his shoulder. Shinji
    turned away from the view and examined the note under the moonlight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>There's
    no way we can toss that enormous rope over there. Besides we left the
    rope behind. What are we going to do?</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    hadn't explained that yet. They'd been too frantic in their search
    for the equipment. Shinji nodded, took out his pencil, and wrote on
    the student notepad, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>Wire.
    I brought some. We'll reel out the wire down to the other side and
    tie it to the rope. Then we'll draw in the rope by pulling the wire
    right before we execute our plan.</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    handed the pad over to Yutaka. After reading the note, he looked at
    Shinji and nodded, as if satisfied. Then he wrote, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>You're
    going to tie a rock to the wire and throw it over there?</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shook his head. Yutaka opened his eyes, surprised. Then after some
    thought he wrote again, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>Are
    you going to make a bow and arrow and shoot the wire across?</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shook his head again. He took the pad and began scribbling, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>That
    might work. But even I can't throw a rock 300m away. And I can't
    afford to miss. If the rock hits the school we're done. And if the
    wire gets caught somewhere and we end up breaking it...I have a
    better plan.</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    didn't take up his pencil this time and only gazed back at Shinji as
    if saying, &quot;?&quot; Shinji took the pad and continued, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>First,
    tie the wire to a tree here. Then go down the mountain with the other
    end of wire. Stretch it taut when we're on the other side.</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    read this but then almost immediately gave Shinji a skeptical look.
    He wrote quickly, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>You
    can't do that his note read It'll get caught in the trees. Somewhere
    in the middle.</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    grinned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    couldn't blame Yutaka for doubting him. The path they'd taken here
    was covered with trees, both large and small. Even if they managed to
    drag the wire out while avoiding G-7 and tugged on it later, the wire
    might get caught. It would make for an odd-looking piece of outdoor
    contemporary art. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>&quot;This
    installation piece is gigantic, but five meters away it turns
    obscure. The piece addresses the delicate balance between nature and
    human postmodern industrialism...&quot;</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    top of that, sector G-7 was filled with dense forestry bordering up
    to the school. Unless you were a 100-meter-tall giant—and&nbsp;wasn't
    there a video his uncle had shown him, an old special-effects movie
    where the superhero saves the world by fighting against monsters as
    they completely tear up the city? They don't make movies like that
    anymore—you'd have to cut down all the trees if you wanted to put
    the wire near the school. It was so obvious. And that was why&nbsp;Yutaka
    insisted it was impossible.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shinji elegantly spread his arms out (given how they were on their
    stomachs though, the effect wasn't&nbsp;so impressive) and wrote, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>How
    about launching an ad balloon, huh, Yutaka'?</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    read the note and knit his brows. Shinji signaled Yutaka to get off
    the cliff rock and follow him. Once they sat under the rock, he
    rummaged through his day pack. He pulled out the contents and lined
    them up on the ground.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    half dozen gas canisters, several hundred-meter reels of thin fishing
    wire (that was all he found at the farm coop), plastic tape, and a
    box of black plastic garbage bags.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    took one of the canisters and showed it to Yutaka. It was painted
    blue with bright red letters which read &quot;VOICE CHANGER&quot;
    (underneath the ad copy read, &quot;Now you'll be the life of the
    party!&quot; huh!), and under that there was an illustration of a
    duck—Shinji recognized where it came from—based on a Walt Disney
    character. A whistlelike object poked out of the canister.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    wrote, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>I
    remembered seeing these at the house where I found the PowerBook. You
    know what this is?</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    taking the pulley, Shinji had gone into the nearby house to retrieve
    these canisters. What in the world would the occupant of that house
    do with all these things, though? The files left on the PowerBook's
    hard drive offered a clue. Given how they had names like &quot;5th
    Grade Science&quot; or &quot;Third Term Report Card Drafts,&quot; the
    owner of the machine must have been an elementary school teacher.
    Yes, he was probably one of the real teachers at that school.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    touched his throat and opened his mouth. Shinji nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Right.
    It makes you sound like a duck! It's helium. And this one's a defect.
    So it's still loaded with gas.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    still seemed unconvinced. Shinji thought an actual demonstration
    would get his point across quicker so he tore open the pack of
    garbage bags and pulled out a bag. He opened it up, inserted the
    canister valve (which was supposed to be sucked) into it, and taped
    it to the bag with the plastic tape. He sealed the edge of the bag
    with more tape. Then he pressed the valve button and the bag began to
    inflate.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    his finger on the button, Shinji thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>this
    would be a lot more entertaining with condoms. But even if they had
    condoms they would have been a little too small. Huh?&nbsp;Do I have
    some on me? Well, I mean, come on, this was supposed to be a study
    trip. Anything can happen, right? You tossed your clothes, but you're
    still holding onto these? Yeah, I dunno, I do still have them. Well,
    you never know when they might come in handy. Let's not go into
    details.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    filling up the bag, Shinji twisted the edge right above the canister
    and sealed it with tape. He took a reel of fishing wire and tied its
    end to the end of the bag. Then he removed the tape below to release
    it from the canister. Just to be sure, he folded the edge over again,
    sealing it again with more tape.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    garbage bag floated upward. It rose until the wire was taut to the
    point where it almost seemed to lift the reel—but it stopped right
    at Shinji and Yutaka's heads.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;See?&quot;
    Shinji said out loud. Yutaka had probably realized what was going on
    while Shinji was working on the canister. He'd already nodded several
    times.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    tied another piece of wire from another reel to the wire stretching
    under the balloon. Just to be&nbsp;sure, he secured this to the
    balloon with tape. With the pair of wires in both of his hands, he
    moved the balloon as if it were walking on a pair of legs. Then he
    pointed to a nearby tree. He moved the string. Yes, in other words,
    these were the legs of the giant. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>They
    were too frail to crush a city and right now they're shorter than me,
    but...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    seemed to understand completely. He gave two huge nods. Then he moved
    his lips without saying anything. It looked like he was saying,
    &quot;Awesome, Shinji.&quot; Or maybe it was, &quot;Enough already.&quot;
    Whatever, it didn't matter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    took the memo pad and wrote, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>We
    make one or two more balloons and attach them to each other. But I
    still don't know how far up the wire can be stretched. There's also

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    read this and nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    glanced up at the sky. The bags were black, so even under the moon,
    Sakamochi and his men wouldn't see them. Right now there wasn't much
    wind either. But he had no idea what it was like further up there in
    the sky.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    cup?&quot; Noriko was sitting on the edge of the bed with her hands
    by her thighs. Moonlight spilled in over the curtain from the window.

    <p class="western" >

    was boiling water in the dark kitchen. The tip of the cigarette

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Shuya said. Shogo turned around. The afterimage of his cigarette
    traced a thick line before vanishing. &quot;Noriko was wondering if
    she could have some hot water. She said one cup was enough—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ah.&quot;
    Shogo didn't let him continue. He removed his cigarette from his
    mouth. Shuya could see Shogo was smiling in the dim moonlight coming
    through the window. &quot;Sure. A cup or an entire bucket, fine with
    me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he moved he scooped up water with the bowl from the bucket and added
    it to the pot. He repeated this five times. He kept a low charcoal
    flame going to keep the water in the pot boiling. Shuya felt some
    steam drift by.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;She's

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.&quot;
    Shogo seemed to be shaking his head. Squinting his eyes, Shuya could
    see three cups and a coffee dripper already loaded with a filter on
    the table. There was also a tea bag for Noriko.</font></font></p>

    lifted his brow, &quot;What is it? All of a sudden you're so chatty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    chuckled. &quot;I understand how you feel about Yoshitoki, but don't
    forget about Noriko's feelings.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    fell silent again. The he spoke. For some reason, there was a hint of
    dissatisfaction in his tone of voice. &quot;I know.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    have a girlfriend?&quot; Shogo proceeded to ask.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shrugged. &quot;Nope.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then
    what's the problem?&quot; Shogo continued to look at the window,
    smoking his cigarette. &quot;It's not a bad thing to be loved.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shrugged again. Then he asked, &quot;Don't you have someone?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    cigarette glowed brightly. He didn't say anything. The smoke drifted
    slowly through the dark. &quot;A secret, huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No...&quot;
    Shogo began to speak, but then he removed the cigarette from his
    mouth and tossed it into the bucket of water. &quot;Get down, Shuya,&quot;
    he whispered and crouched down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nervously obeyed him. Was someone going to attack? He grew tense.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Get
    Noriko. Be quiet though,&quot; Shogo whispered again. Shuya was
    already on his way to the&nbsp;examination room, where Noriko was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    was still sitting in a daze on the edge of the bed. Shuya signaled
    her to duck down. She must have immediately understood because she
    got off the bed, holding her breath. Shuya offered her his hand for
    support as they moved to the kitchen. He looked over to the entrance
    on the way there, but there was no one beyond the glass door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    had already gathered their day packs which he'd packed with refilled
    water bottles and other items, and now he was on his knees by the
    back door, holding his shotgun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it?&quot; Shuya asked in a hushed voice. Shogo lifted his left
    hand to silence him. Shuya didn't say another word.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Someone's
    outside,&quot; Shogo whispered. &quot;We'll exit through whichever
    door they don't enter.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    only thing visible in the dark was the bright charcoal flame under
    the pot. Given the location of the sink, it couldn't be seen from
    outside.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    heard a tapping sound. It came from the entrance. The door wouldn't
    open because of the stick jamming it. The glass was broken, so the
    person outside must have realized that someone had entered the
    building and that it was probably still occupied.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a clacking sound, but then it stopped. It sounded like the person
    had given up.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    groaned. &quot;Damn, we'll be in trouble if this one tries to set
    this place on fire.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    remained quiet, but there was still no sound. Then Shogo signaled for
    them to move towards the entrance. He might have heard a slight
    sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were nearly crawling down the hall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    they made their way, Shogo, behind the other two, reached out to
    Shuya who was leading. They stopped. Shuya turned around and looked
    over his shoulder at Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;He's
    circling back to the front.&quot; He waved his hand to the back.
    &quot;Let's go out the back.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    they went towards the kitchen down the hall.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stopped again before they entered the kitchen.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn,
    why?&quot; he muttered.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    person outside was now coming round to the back door again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    silence continued. Shogo held onto his shotgun. With Noriko between
    him and Shogo, Shuya also gripped the SIG-Sauer that had once
    belonged to Kaori Minami. (He'd given the Smith &amp; Wesson to
    Shogo. Shuya decided to hold onto the gun that had more bullets.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    the silence was suddenly broken. A voice called from outside the
    kitchen window. &quot;It's Hiroki,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not
    fighting. Respond, you three. Who are you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was undoubtedly the voice of Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No. 11),
    who along with Shinji Mimura was one of the few classmates Shuya
    could trust.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    the—?&quot; Shuya moaned. &quot;That's incredible...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a stroke of luck. He never thought they'd see Hiroki. Shuya and
    Noriko looked at each other. Noriko looked relieved.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stopped Shuya as he tried to get up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shh.
    Don't raise your voice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stared at Shogo's serious expression and then responded with an
    exaggerated shrug and smiled. &quot;Don't worry. I'll vouch for him.
    We can totally trust him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shook his head and said, &quot;How did he know there were three of
    us?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    thought hadn't occurred to Shuya. He thought it over while looking at
    Shogo. But he had no idea. That didn't matter though. The important
    thing was that Hiroki was here. He just wanted to see Hiroki's face
    now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Maybe
    he saw us go in here, from far away. That's why he didn't know who we
    were.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    took him so long to get here then?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought again. &quot;He probably deliberated over whether he should
    find out who was here or not. In any case, we can trust Hiroki. I'll
    vouch for him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    ignored Shogo, who looked like he wasn't satisfied. He raised his
    voice and directed it beyond the window. &quot;It's Shuya, Hiroki.
    I'm with Shogo Kawada and Noriko Nakagawa.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya!...&quot;
    a relieved voice replied. &quot;Let me in. Where should I come in?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    Shuya could answer, Shogo raised his voice, &quot;This is Shogo. Go
    to the front entrance. Keep your hands behind your head and do not
    move. Got that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo—&quot;
    Shuya was about to protest, but Hiroki immediately responded, &quot;Got
    it.&quot; What looked like the upper body of Hiroki crossed the
    frosted glass window.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    bent down to look out of the cracks in the glass. Holding onto his
    shotgun, he yanked out the obstructing stick and opened the door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    Sugimura was standing with his hands behind his neck. He was slightly
    taller than Shogo, but more slender. His hair, wavy like Shuya's,
    went down the middle of his forehead. His day pack was by his feet
    and for some reason there was a 1.5-meter stick on the ground.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was true. Shuya shifted his eyes, as if it were a miracle. Shuya's
    face made Hiroki grin.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    have to do a body check.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,
    come on.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    paid no attention to Shuya's protest and moved forward, holding onto
    his shotgun. He went behind Hiroki and first checked his hands behind
    his neck. Then he rubbed his left hand over Hiroki's school coat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    hand stopped at a pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    the hell's this?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Go
    ahead and pull it out,&quot; Hiroki said with his hands held
    together. &quot;But give it back to me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    pulled it out. It was the size and shape of a thick notepad, but it
    was made of plastic or steel. The cover panel reflected the
    moonlight. After fiddling around with it, Shogo said, &quot;Ah ha.&quot;
    He moved his body with the object in his hands and then looked down
    at the cover panel against the moonlight. He nodded and returned it
    to Hiroki's pocket. Then he thoroughly searched Hiroki down to his
    pant cuffs. He also checked his day pack and finally announced,
    &quot;Okay. Sorry about that. You can put your hands down.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    unlocked his hands and picked up his day pack and stick. The stick
    appeared to be his weapon.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki.&quot;
    Shuya broke into a smile. &quot;Come on in. We have coffee. You want
    some?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    nodded somewhat hesitantly as he went through the entrance. Shogo
    looked outside and then shut the door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    stood still. With his back to the shoe cabinet that was filled with
    slippers, Shogo stared at Hiroki. The Remington muzzle was pointed
    down, but Shuya noticed Shogo's finger still on the trigger and felt
    slightly annoyed. He did his best not to let it get to him, though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    looked at Shuya and Noriko again, and then glanced over at Shogo.
    That was when Shuya realized that Hiroki was troubled not so much by
    him and Noriko as he was by them hooking up with Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    addressed the issue. &quot;Shuya, Hiroki seems to want to ask whether
    it's all right for you guys to be with me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    smiled slightly and looked over at Shogo, and said, &quot;No, I just
    thought it was an odd combination.&quot; Still smiling, he continued,
    &quot;Shuya would never be with you if you were hostile. Shuya can be
    pretty stupid when it comes to certain things, but he's not that
    stupid.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    responded with a grin. He still kept his finger on the trigger
    though. In any case, for now Hiroki and Shogo were finished
    introducing themselves.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ah,
    come on, Hiroki,&quot; Shuya gave him a smile.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Noriko said, &quot;Come on in. It's not our house, so I can't
    apologize for its messiness.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Hiroki smiled, but he stayed at the entrance. Shuya supported Noriko
    with his left hand and then pointed at the hall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on in. We'll have to get going soon, but we have a little time. We'll
    throw you a welcoming party.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Hiroki stood still there. Shuya realized how he'd forgotten to share
    an important detail. Hiroki might have been appalled Shuya was using
    the word &quot;party&quot; in this situation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki,
    we can get out of here. Shogo is going to help us.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki's
    eyes widened a little. &quot;Really?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. But then Hiroki looked down. Then he looked up again.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Thing
    is...&quot; he said and shook his head, &quot;there's something I
    have to take care of.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Something?&quot;
    Shuya knit his brows. &quot;Why don't you first come on in—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Instead
    of taking Shuya up on his invitation, he asked, &quot;Have you three
    been together all this time?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought it over and then shook his head. &quot;No. Well, me and
    Noriko were. And then...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he remembered what happened this morning. It'd been a while since the
    image of Tatsumichi Oki's skull split open assaulted him, and once
    again he felt a chill run down his spine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;...yeah.
    A lot of stuff happened, and we ended up joining Shogo.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see.&quot; Hiroki nodded and then said. &quot;Hey, have you guys seen
    Kotohiki?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Kotohiki?&quot;
    Shuya repeated. Kayoko Kotohiki (Female Student No. 8)? The one who,
    in spite of being into tea ceremony, seemed more playful than
    elegant?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.&quot;
    Shuya shook his head. &quot;We haven't but...&quot; He thought of
    Shogo and looked over at him, but he also shook his head, saying, &quot;I
    haven't seen her either.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course Kayoko Kotohiki had to be on this island. As long as her name
    wasn't announced yet in Sakamochi's announcements, she had to be
    alive. Unless she was killed after 6 p.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    again he realized how he was letting most of his classmates die and
    felt awful.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    about Kotohiki?&quot; Noriko asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh.&quot;
    Hiroki shook his head. &quot;It's no big deal. Thanks. Sorry, but I
    have to get going.&quot; He gave Shuya a parting glance and turned to
    go.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on, Hiroki!&quot; Shuya stopped him. &quot;Where are you going? I
    told you we're safe with us, didn't I?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    looked back at Shuya. There was a sad look in his eyes, but they
    still gave away that humorous trace of irony. It might have been a
    look all his close friends shared. Yoshitoki Kuninobu (deceased,
    damn), and of course Shinji Mimura, and—now it seemed—Shogo
    Kawada.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    have to see Kayoko Kotohiki about something. So I have to go.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something.
    What could that possibly be in this situation where moving around
    would only increase your chances of dying? Finally Shuya said, &quot;Hold
    on. You can't go...not with any real weapons. It's too risky. And how
    are you going to find her?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    bit his lower lip. Then he pulled out that object resembling a mobile
    data terminal from his pocket and showed it to Shuya. &quot;This is
    the 'weapon' I got in my day pack. Professor Kawada over there could
    explain.&quot; He pointed at his neck while his hand held the device.
    The silver collars around the necks of Shuya, Noriko, and Shogo were
    all shining. &quot;Looks like this device detects anyone wearing
    these collars. Once someone's in the vicinity, they show up on the
    screen. But you can't tell whose collar it is.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    finally figured out the answer to Shogo's questions. It was thanks to
    this device Hiroki had been able to announce there were three of them
    and detect their movements. Like the computer at the school
    monitoring their positions, it could detect the position of anyone
    wearing a collar, even if, as Hiroki said, you couldn't tell who it
    was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    put the device back into the pocket. &quot;See you—&quot; He was
    ready to go when he suddenly stopped, &quot;Oh, one more thing.
    Beware of Mitsuko Souma,&quot; he added. He gave Shuya and then Shogo
    a stern look. &quot;She's playing the game. I don't know about the
    others, but I know for sure she is.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Did
    you fight her?&quot; Shogo asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    shook his head. &quot;No. I didn't, but Taka-Takako Chigusa said so
    before she died. Mitsuko killed Takako.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    suddenly recalled how Takako was already dead. After hearing
    Sakamochi announce her death, he'd been concerned about its effect on
    Hiroki, but he was so happy to see him he'd forgotten this dreadful
    fact.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    and Takako Chigusa were close. For a while, Shuya actually thought
    they were going out. But when he'd casually asked him about it,
    Hiroki chuckled and said, &quot;She's in a different class. We've
    known each other since we were kids. You know hide-and-seek, that
    kind of thing. When we used to fight, I'd be the one crying.&quot; Of
    course Takako Chigusa was an amazing athlete, and pretty aggressive,
    but her taking on Hiroki, who was now over 180 centimeters tall and
    ranked in martial arts—a while back, the only time he visited his
    house, Hiroki reluctantly showed him how he could split a piece of
    pine wood with the palm of his hand—just&nbsp;preposterously funny.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    now Takako Chigusa was dead. And given the way Hiroki had just
    described it, he was there when she died.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you were with her?&quot; Noriko asked quietly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    shook his head. &quot;Just the very end. I...when we left, I hid in
    front of the school, waiting for her. But then Yoshio came back, and
    I got too distracted, so I lost Takako. Then as I looked for Takako,
    I ended up losing my chance to join you, Shuya, and Shinji.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded several times. So Hiroki was in front of the school until
    Yoshio Akamatsu returned. He probably hid in the woods. It was
    dangerous, of course. But that only showed how important Takako was
    to Hiroki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But,&quot;
    Hiroki continued, &quot;I found Takako. I was...too late though.&quot;
    Saying this much, Hiroki looked down. He shook his head several
    times. Without being told, Shuya understood that by the time Hiroki
    had found Takako she was dying from being attacked by Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought of telling him how Yoshio Akamatsu had killed Mayumi Tendo,
    and how he had almost killed Shuya as well, but it was irrelevant
    now. Yoshio Akamatsu was dead now too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know what to say, but I'm so sorry,&quot; Noriko said.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    smiled a little and nodded. &quot;Thanks.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;In
    any case,&quot; Shuya said, &quot;Come on in. Let's talk it over,
    what's the—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    meant to say &quot;rush&quot; but refrained. If Hiroki wanted to see
    Kayoko Kotohiki while they were both still alive, what else could he
    do but rush? While Hiroki's connection to Takako Chigusa was clear,
    Shuya had no idea why it was so important for him to find Kayoko
    Kotohiki. But in any case, as they sat here talking, she could be
    fighting someone, or she might even be dying.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    grinned. It seemed he knew what Shuya was thinking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    licked his lips. He glanced over at Shogo and then said, &quot;If you
    insist.&quot; He looked at Hiroki and continued, &quot;We'll find her
    with you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Hiroki flatly refused. He pointed his chin at Noriko. &quot;Noriko's
    injured. It's too dangerous. No.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    found the situation unbearable. &quot;But you could be saved with us.
    How are we going to meet again if you leave?&quot; Once they
    separated it would be nearly impossible for them to meet again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki.&quot;
    It was Shogo. He still held the shotgun, but his finger wasn't on the
    trigger anymore. Hiroki looked over at him, and Shogo pulled out
    something small from his pocket with his open hand. He lifted it to
    his mouth and bit on its metal end, twisting it. It made the chirping
    sound of a bird. It was a loud, brilliant, and playful sound. Like a
    robin or chickadee.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    released his hand from his mouth, and Shuya realized that it was
    Shogo's device—a bird call? Forget why he would have one in the
    first place—it was one of those things that mimicked the sound of
    birds chirping.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Whether
    you meet Kayoko Kotohiki or not,&quot; Shogo said, &quot;if you want
    to see us, make a fire somewhere and burn raw wood to get some smoke
    going. Make two fires. Of course, leave as soon as you make them
    because you'll only attract attention. And make sure you don't cause
    a fire. Once we see that we'll make this call every fifteen minutes,
    say, for fifteen seconds. Try to find us by following this sound.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    pointed to the bird call.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    sound is your ticket out of here. If you're up for it, you can come
    aboard our train.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    nodded. &quot;Okay. I will, thanks.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took out his map. He unfolded it and handed the map and his pencil
    over to Hiroki. &quot;Also, I'm sorry for keeping you, but I need you
    to mark where Takako was killed. If you saw anyone else, I need to
    know those locations too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    lifted his brow slightly as he took the map. He spread the map out on
    the shoe cabinet, under the moonlit window, and held the pencil.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Give
    me your map. I'll write in the locations of the bodies we know,&quot;
    Shogo said. Hiroki stopped writing and handed over his map. The two
    began marking the maps side by side.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    bring some coffee over,&quot; Noriko said and left Shuya's arm. She
    limped down the hall, using the wall as support.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Did
    Takako say whether Mitsuko had a machine gun?&quot; Shogo asked as he
    wrote.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,&quot;
    Hiroki answered without lifting his eyes, &quot;She didn't say
    anything about that. I do know that she was shot several times. It
    wasn't a single bullet.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    the two proceeded, Shuya explained the fates of Yoshio Akamatsu,
    Tatsumichi Oki, and Kyoichi Motobuchi. Hiroki nodded as he continued
    to write.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    was done marking Hiroki's map. He pointed at it and explained, &quot;This
    is where Kaori Minami was killed. Shuya saw Hirono Shimizu escape.
    She might have done it in self-defense. But either way, you should be
    careful.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    nodded. Then unexpectedly he said, &quot;I saw Kaori too,&quot; and
    pointed at the map. &quot;Before noon. She fired at me, but I think
    she was in a panic.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded and exchanged Hiroki's map with his.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    came out into the hall, holding a cup. Shuya went down the hall and
    took it from Noriko, who walked unsteadily. He offered it to Hiroki,
    who took a sniff, whistled lightly, and then held it. &quot;Thanks,&quot;
    he said and took a sip. Then he put the cup on the raised entrance
    floor. It was nearly full.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'll
    see ya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on.&quot; Shuya pulled out his SIG-Sauer from under his belt. With
    its grip pointed at Hiroki, he offered it to him. He also pulled out
    an extra cartridge from his pocket. &quot;If you still insist on
    going take these, okay? We have a shotgun and one more gun.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    first gun was Kyoichi Motobuchi's, and the Smith &amp; Wesson was now
    with Shogo. Shuya's handing over the SIG-Sauer gun would decrease
    their fighting capacity, but Shogo didn't intervene.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Hiroki shook his head. &quot;You need that, Shuya. You better protect
    Noriko all right. I can't take that. Even if someone attacks me, I
    just can't do it.&quot; He tilted his head and then examined both
    Shuya and Noriko. He broke into a slight grin and then added, &quot;I
    always wondered why you two weren't going out.&quot; Then he nodded
    at each of them and quietly opened the entrance door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki,&quot;
    Noriko called. Her voice was quiet. &quot;Be careful.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    will. Hey, thanks. And best of luck to you guys.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki,&quot;
    Shuya was getting choked up, but managed to say, &quot;We'll meet
    again. That's a promise.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    nodded and left. Shuya held Noriko and stepped through the front
    entrance, watching Hiroki as he quickly ascended the mountain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    a word, Shogo gestured to Shuya and Noriko to move back and close the
    door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath and turned around. He could barely see the steam
    still rising from the cup Hiroki had left on the floor.</font></font></p>

    rest of the sky, obscuring the stars.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    nodded. &quot;I'm fine.&quot; But Shuya could tell she was still
    unsteady.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at his watch. It was past 11 p.m. now, but they'd already left
    G-9, which was now a forbidden zone. They had to find another place
    to settle down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were tracing their way back along the foot of the northern mountain.
    The area was scattered with trees. A little further down and they'd
    be near where Kaori Minami was killed. Immediately to their left,
    Shuya saw a flat, narrow area that extended from the island's
    residential area on the eastern shore. The flat land spotted with
    houses then became increasingly narrow, like a triangle. The road
    traversing the&nbsp;island supposedly passed through this pivot and
    headed to the western shore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    turned around. &quot;Now what do we do?&quot; Noriko's blanket was
    tied to the top of the day pack on his shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Can
    we stop at a house, like we did just now?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;A
    house, huh.&quot; Shogo looked away from Shuya and squinted. &quot;It's
    really not a good idea. As the number of zones decrease so do the
    number of houses. The moment someone needs something, they'll want to
    enter a house. Whether it's to eat or whatever.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    if you're worried about me, I'm fine now. Even outside,&quot; Noriko
    said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    flashed a smile and then silently looked over the flat land. He
    looked as if he was taking Hiroki's marks on his map into
    consideration as he took in the view.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Along
    with the bodies he'd seen, Hiroki had given detailed explanations of
    how they had died. The body of Kazushi Niida was right near where
    Takako Chigusa had died. Along with his eyes being gouged out (!),
    his throat had been stabbed. In the residential area that was now
    forbidden was Megumi Eto. Her throat had been slashed by a blade.
    (Shuya felt a pang in his chest over this one, since Noriko had told
    him how Megumi had a crush on him.) To the east, Yoji Kuramoto and
    Yoshimi Yahagi were killed where the eastern shore's residential area
    met the southern mountain. Yoji was stabbed in the head, and Yoshimi
    had been shot. At the southern tip, Izumi Kanai, Hiroshi Kuronaga,
    Ryuhei Sasagawa, and Mitsuru Numai were all found dead together.
    Mitsuru Numai was shot several times, while the others' throats were
    slashed. Three of Kiriyama's group had died together, the only
    exception being Sho Tsukioka, who got caught in a forbidden zone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Shuya said. Shogo looked back. &quot;Do you think Mitsuko Souma
    killed Yukiko and Yumiko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even
    now, as he asked this, it all felt so unreal. He didn't believe a
    girl could do such horrible things. Of course he had no doubt, since
    it was Hiroki who'd informed them, but he still couldn't restrain the
    urge to dismiss it all as a delusion.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,&quot;
    Shogo shook his head. &quot;I don't think so. After Yukiko and Yumiko
    got killed by that machine gun, you know how we heard pistols going
    off? That was to finish them off. But Hiroki said Takako was alive
    after being shot when he found her. Which means her killer wasn't as
    thorough. Of course she might have let Takako go, knowing she was
    going to die anyway. But given the times and locations, I just don't
    think Mitsuko Souma's the one with the machine gun.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    recalled the machine gun fire he heard before 9 a.m. The killer was
    still roaming around the island. And the distant gunfire they heard a
    little afterwards, was that Mitsuko Souma?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Eventually
    we'll—&quot; Shogo forced a grin and shook his head, &quot;—meet
    him or her. Then we'll know for sure.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    recalled something else that had been bugging him. &quot;When Hiroki
    showed us his radar, I was thinking how Sakamochi must know we're
    together and our positions as well.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    answered as he surveyed the flat land, &quot;Yeah.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    moved his shoulder to give Noriko better support. &quot;Won't that
    hinder our escape?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    chuckled with his back to Shuya. &quot;Nope. Not at all. Don't
    worry.&quot; Shogo looked over the flat land again and said, &quot;Let's
    go back to where we were.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    continued, &quot;A common strategy players in this game take is to
    show up anywhere they hear some action. That's because of the 24-hour
    deadline. Because of that limitation, they kill when they can. And
    the fact that they're on a killing spree means they're on their own,
    so they can't afford to sleep much. So the match has to be kept
    short. If something happens near them, they go there, and if there's
    a fight already going on, they sit back and then they finish off any
    survivors. That's why we should stay somewhere we can avoid
    confrontations. If we get mixed up with someone who's panicking then
    one of the top players is bound to show up. If we go back where we
    were it's unlikely we'll meet anyone. Since Tatsumichi Old and
    Kyoichi Motobuchi, who'd been hiding there, are no longer around,
    that area is pretty much uninhabited.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    Hirono ran in that direction.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    I doubt she's gone that far. It wouldn't be necessary.&quot; Shogo
    pointed to the flat land with his thumb. &quot;But we'll avoid this
    mountain where she might be hiding. We'll take a different route.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    lifted his brow. &quot;Is it safe for us to move through the flat
    land?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled and shook his head. &quot;The moon may be shining, but this
    isn't daylight. I think we're safer there than in the mountain, where
    there's too much cover.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. Shogo took the lead and began descending the slope. Shuya
    held the SIG-Sauer tightly in his right hand and followed Shogo as he
    supported Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    trees turned into a field of short grass. The first farm they came
    across had a field full of squashes. Beyond this field there was a
    wheat field. This island was so small these probably weren't for
    domestic consumption. Of course the Republic of Greater East Asia was
    incessantly issuing orders to promote national self-reliance, so even
    a small farm like this might contribute a little to the effort. As
    they moved along the edge of the farm, the soil under their sneakers
    felt dry. Maybe it was because several days had passed since the area
    had been evacuated. Still, Shuya was struck by the pleasant, rich
    odor of wheat drifting through the evening air, anticipating the
    summer.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a nice smell. Especially after having smelled so much blood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a tractor to their left. Beyond the vehicle there was a house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was an ordinary, two-story house and appeared relatively new. It was
    probably one of those cheap, mass produced buildings resembling
    Banana Homes or Vertebrae Houses. Even though it was in the middle of
    the farm, it was enclosed by a concrete wall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at Shogo's back as he moved forward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    irked him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked back. Noriko was leaning on his left shoulder as she walked,
    but he noticed something high above her head in the middle of the
    sky. Something flashing in the moonlight, tracing an arc. This object
    came flying at them.</font></font></p>

    made Shuya such a star athlete in his Little League days was his

    light Shuya could tell that the object flying towards them right now</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	resembled
    a can. Of course, they were in the serene Seto Inland Sea region, so

    hurricane. There was no way it was an empty can.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    suddenly released his shoulder, which was tucked under Noriko's right
    armpit. He couldn't even afford to call on Shogo, who must have
    realized something odd though, because he also suddenly turned
    around, while Noriko tottered without Shuya's support.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    dashed out. His jumping ability was quite extraordinary. Just as in
    the past, during the Little League prefectural semifinals, he could
    make the ultimate play from any given position, stealing the
    opponents' winning home run in the bottom of the eleventh inning.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    caught the ball—no, the can—in mid-air with his left hand. He put
    it in his right hand, and as he came down he twisted his body and
    threw it as far as he could.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt the air burst as a sonic boom tore through his eardrums. The
    bomb blast blew him away before he could land, and he fell sprawling
    onto the ground. If he'd waited for the hand grenade to fall, he,
    Noriko, and Shogo would have all been mincemeat now. Although
    Sakamochi's crew might have reduced the grenade's explosive power so
    that it couldn't be used against the school, it was more than capable
    of killing human beings.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    raised his head. He realized, he heard nothing. His ears were screwed
    up. In this state of silence, Shuya saw Noriko collapsed on his left.

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	—another

    it was too late now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    disabled ears all of a sudden heard a definite but muffled bang,
    almost simultaneously followed by another explosion in the air. This
    sound was also muffled, but this time it felt a little further off
    and Shuya wasn't blown away. Right beside him Shogo was on one knee,
    holding his shotgun. He had shot the hand grenade, as if he were
    skeet shooting, blowing it to bits before it managed to explode.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    ran over to Noriko and held her up. She was grimacing. She seemed to
    be moaning, but he couldn't hear her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya,
    get back!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    waved his hand and fired his shotgun with his right hand. Shuya then
    heard a different sound, rattling gunfire, and the wheat heads right
    in front of him scattered into the air. Shogo fired another two
    shots. In a state of confusion, Shuya pulled Noriko into the shade of
    the ridge marking off the farm. He got down. Shogo slid to his side,
    firing several shots as he went. The rattling continued, and the
    ridge soil blew up, grains flying into his eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pulled out his SIG-Sauer and looked out from the shade of the ridge.
    He fired blindly in the direction Shogo was firing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he saw him. Less than thirty meters away, the unique slicked-back
    hair behind the break in the house's concrete wall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No. 6). And although Shuya's hearing
    was impaired, he could recall the sound of the rattling gunfire. It
    was the same sound he heard from far away when Yumiko and&nbsp;Yukiko
    fell at the northern mountain peak. Of course he might not have been
    the only one with a machine gun, but even so, Kazuo, who was right in
    front of their very own eyes, had just tried to kill them without
    warning, with of all things a hand grenade!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was certain Kazuo was the one who'd murdered Yumiko and Yukiko. He
    thought of how they were killed and felt a flash of rage.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    the...what's the hell's he doing!?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    shouting, just shoot!&quot; Shogo handed the Smith &amp; Wesson to
    Shuya and reloaded his shotgun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    held a gun in each hand and began shooting at the concrete wall.
    (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Two-hand
    shooter! This is crazy!</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)
    First the Smith &amp; Wesson, then the SIG-Sauer ran out of bullets.
    He had to reload!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Having
    waited for this moment, Kazuo got up. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>BRRRRATTA</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Sparks flew out from him. Shuya ducked, and Kazuo revealed part of
    his body that was behind the wall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    blasted his shotgun away. Kazuo's body once again vanished. The swarm
    of shotgun pellets blew off part of the wall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    ejected the empty magazine from his SIG-Sauer and pulled out a loaded
    magazine from his pocket. He opened the Smith &amp; Wesson cylinder
    and pushed the rod in the center of the cylinder to release its spent
    shells, puffed up from the explosions. One of the shells nearly
    singed part of his right thumb. It didn't matter. He quickly loaded
    the .38 caliber bullets Shogo had rolled over his way. Then he aimed
    at Kazuo's house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shot again, blowing off another part of the wall. Shuya also fired
    several shots into it with his SIG-Sauer.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko!
    Are you all right!?&quot; Shuya yelled. Right next to him, Noriko
    answered, &quot;I'm okay.&quot; He could make out her response, which
    made Shuya realize his hearing was back. He saw her in the corner of
    his eye reloading 9mm Short bullets into the SIG-Sauer's empty
    magazine. Of all the things he'd seen since the game began this one
    really sent his head reeling. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    could a girl like Noriko be participating in a battle like this...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    hand appeared from the other side of the wall. The hand was holding a
    machine gun. It rattled again. Shuya and Shogo ducked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    got up. As he continued shooting, he came forward. Then he ran behind
    the tractor. The distance between them was shrinking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    fired a shot, blowing off the tractor's driving panel.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Shuya called, after shooting twice.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;
    Shogo answered as he reloaded his shotgun.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    fast can you run the hundred-meter dash?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took another shot (annihilating the tractor's rear light) and
    answered, &quot;I'm pretty slow. Maybe thirteen seconds. My back's
    strong though. Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    Kazuo's arm stuck out from behind the tractor. Sparks flew as Kazuo
    revealed his head, but as Shuya and Shogo fired back, he ducked
    again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    can only retreat into the mountain, right?&quot; Shuya spoke quickly.
    &quot;I can run a hundred meters in almost less than eleven seconds.
    You and Noriko go ahead. I'll keep Kazuo there.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    glanced at Shuya. That was all. He understood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;At
    the place we were, Shuya. The place where we talked about rock,&quot;
    Shogo said quickly. He gave Shuya his shotgun and retreated into a
    ducking position. He moved around over to Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath and shot three times into the tractor with the
    shotgun, prompting Shogo to lift Noriko and run in the direction
    they'd come from. Noriko's eyes flashed by Shuya's for a moment.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo's
    upper body appeared from behind the tractor. Shuya fired his shotgun
    several times. Kazuo, who had his gun pointed at Shogo and Noriko,
    ducked. Shuya realized he was out of shotgun shells so he picked up
    the Smith &amp; Wesson instead and began shooting again. He
    immediately used up five bullets. He opened the SIG-Sauer and loaded
    the extra magazine Noriko had loaded with bullets and began shooting
    again. It was crucial he keep on shooting.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    saw Shogo and Noriko disappear into the mountain.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    SIG-Sauer was empty, and there were no more extra magazines. He could
    only reload bullets....</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then this time Kazuo's arm appeared from behind the tractor's blade.
    The Ingram machine gun rattled away. Just like before. Kazuo was
    running towards him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had to get out of this gunfight. He held onto only the empty
    SIG-Sauer (he still had seven more individual 9mm Short bullets),
    turned around, and ran. If he could reach the mountain where there
    was plenty of cover, Kazuo wouldn't be able to get too close to him.
    Shuya decided to head east. Noriko and Shogo would be headed west to
    get where they were yesterday. He wanted to lead Kazuo as far away
    from them as he could.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    all came down to his sprinting speed. He had to get as far away from
    Kazuo as possible in a short span of time. A machine gun basically
    offered a shower of bullets so it was impossible to dodge at a close
    distance. What mattered was how far he could get.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    ran. As the fastest runner in the class (at least he thought so. He
    was even a fraction of a second faster than Shinji Mimura, unless,
    that is, if Kazuo wasn't really trying during his test), he could
    only rely on his speed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    he thought he was five meters away from a tree he heard a rattling
    sound. He felt a severe blow against the left side of his stomach.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    groaned as he began losing his balance, but he kept on running. He
    ran into a row of tall trees and made his way up the slope. The
    rattling resumed and this time his left arm reflexively flinched up.
    He realized he'd been shot right above his elbow.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he still ran. He continued east—</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hey,
    yo, that's a forbidden zone</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">—and
    moved north. More rattling. A thin tree to his right crackled and
    burst into matchstick-sized splinters.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More
    rattling. This time he wasn't hit. Or maybe he was. He couldn't tell
    anymore. He only knew he was being chased. At least he was buying
    time for Noriko and Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    made his way through the trees and vegetation, climbed a hill, and
    then descended it. He couldn't even afford to worry that there might
    be someone else hiding in the dark, waiting to attack him. He had no
    idea how far he'd gotten. He wasn't even sure which direction he was
    running. Sometimes it seemed&nbsp;like he could hear—sometimes it
    seemed like he couldn't—the rattling sound. He couldn't tell maybe
    because his hearing had been impaired by that explosion. In any case
    now was not the time to be relieved. Farther. He had to get farther.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    Shuya slipped. He'd somehow reached a cliff, and all of a sudden
    realized that the slope just dropped off. Just as he'd done when
    fighting Tatsumichi Oki, he tumbled down the steep slope.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    landed with a thud. He was no longer holding the SIG-Sauer. And as he
    tried to stand up he realized he couldn't. He wondered, in a daze, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>am
    I delirious from blood loss? Did I hit my head?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Impossible.

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was almost pitch dark, but beside the dimly moonlit window Shinji
    tossed the item in his hand once again onto the floor. The sound of
    it hitting the floor was muffled by the thick folded blanket, but
    there was a popping sound along with a ring.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    immediately picked it up off the floor and then tucked the small
    plastic item inside the blanket. The sound stopped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on, let's go,&quot; Yutaka said. He'd been watching over Shinji, but
    Shinji signaled him to calm down. He repeated the test again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Pop,
    zing</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    It made the same sounds. Shinji picked it up, and it stopped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Was
    it all right? But if this malfunctioned, then all the careful
    preparations they'd made would come to nothing. One more try—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    have to hurry&quot; Yutaka said again, and Shinji's face was about to
    flush with anger—but he managed to suppress it. Although he wasn't
    entirely satisfied he said, &quot;All right,&quot; and concluded his
    test. He unhooked the lead wire connecting the battery and mini-motor
    which was used for the test and began peeling off the plastic tape
    attaching the motor unit to the battery.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    and Yutaka were back at the &quot;Northern Takamatsu Agricultural
    Cooperative Association, Okishima Island Branch.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Along
    with the school and harbor fishery coop, it might have been one of
    the largest buildings on the island. The space, unlit of course and
    enveloped in darkness, was the size of a basketball court, and there
    was farming equipment strewn all over the area, including a tractor
    and combine harvester. There was also a light truck with a missing
    wheel lifted on a jack, probably to be repaired. Then in the corner
    were piles of sacks of various kinds of fertilizer. (And hazardous
    ammonium nitrate was further beyond them, stored in a large cabinet
    with a provisional lock that Shinji had busted open.) The slate walls
    were at least five meters high, and there was an upper floor attached
    along the north wall where more fertilizer, insecticide, and other
    supplies had been stored. On the opposite, or east, wall was a steel
    staircase diagonally descending from the second floor, and underneath
    the stairs was a large sliding warehouse&nbsp;door. Next to this
    sliding door, in front of the stairs in the southeast corner, was an
    officelike space made up of partition walls. Beyond its open door he
    could make out office equipment, including the outlines of a desk and
    fax machine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Setting
    the wire across sector G-7 where the school was turned out to be a
    hassle. First, Shinji tied the end of the wire to the tip of a tall
    tree behind the rock they'd climbed on. Then he took the other end
    and began walking between the trees, but then a gust in the upper
    region of the sky acted up, so guiding the garbage-bag balloons
    proved to be difficult. There were at least ten occasions where he
    had to climb up a tree to loosen the wire. On top of that, given how
    the enemy could be anywhere in the dark, he had to worry about
    Yutaka, so the endeavor ended up exhausting him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he'd managed to set the wire after a full three hours, when he heard
    the gunfight. It was past 11 p.m. He heard an explosion as well, but
    he couldn't afford to get involved, so he hurried back to the farm
    coop with Yutaka. By then the gunfire had ceased.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally
    Shinji began building the electric detonator, but this also turned
    out to be difficult. He didn't have the proper tools, and furthermore
    the device required a delicate balance. Electric current had to run
    through the device at the moment of impact against the school, but at
    the same time he had to make sure it wasn't so sensitive it'd be
    ignited in the middle of the rope cable by, say, a bump or knot in
    the rope.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    somehow he managed to build it, using a motor (which he removed from
    an electric razor) instead of the detonator for the test. It was
    right when he began testing, in other words, only moments ago, that
    the midnight announcement was made. The only one who died was Hirono
    Shimizu (Female Student No. 10), whom Shinji saw immediately after
    the game began. He thought it might have been a result of that
    intense gun battle, but in any case Sakamochi had announced something
    far more urgent, at least to him and Yutaka. Sector F-7, which
    included the cliff rock they'd climbed up on to survey the school,
    was designated to be a forbidden zone as of 1 a.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No
    wonder Yutaka was so impatient. If they couldn't enter that area then
    all their preparations would amount to nothing. It would be the end
    for them. He didn't want to be in the situation of, after a clever
    play, being just one move away from checkmate only to fall into a
    fatal trap.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    quickly pulled out the electric detonator from the tube chained to
    his knife. He connected the two cylinders—their dull metallic
    exterior shone in the dark—and peeled off the insulation from the
    lead wire. Then using tape, he first secured the small plastic spring
    serving as the electrical switch, then took the end of the lead wire
    extending from the detonator and tied it to the wire from the charge
    device. He taped the connection over and over so it would be
    completely secure. Then next to the battery he installed a condenser
    circuit board taken from the flash component of a camera. In order
    for the detonator to be absolutely reliable, he needed a high voltage
    output. He connected the wires to this device as well. To prevent any
    accidental detonation, he decided he would work on the remaining wire
    from the electric detonator at the top of the mountain, taping the
    exposed end of the wire to the side of the battery.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;All
    right.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stood up, and then put the completed detonation device in his
    pocket.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Let's
    hurry. It's time.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    nodded. Just in case, Shinji tossed his equipment, including the
    electrical pliers and extra lead wire into his day pack, and then
    lifted several piles of rope they had divided up onto his shoulder.
    He looked down. There was a gas can filled up with a mixture of
    gasoline and ammonium nitrate. To add oxygen, he stuffed in
    insulation material filled with air and folded in pleats. The opening
    was shut with the lid, but next to it another rubber lid functioning
    as the detonator holder was tied to it with a plastic cord&nbsp;dangling
    from the handle.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he looked at his watch. It was 12:09. They had plenty of time.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Okay
    then. He was trembling from excitement. It took a lot of effort, but
    now they had everything they needed. They would connect all the ropes
    they had, tying one end to a tree in H-7. Then they would tie the
    other end of the rope to the end of the fishing wire secured by the
    weight of a rock. They would unravel the rope and leave it there and
    then go around the school, going up the mountain into F-7. He would
    take the wire tied to the top of the tree and reel it in immediately.
    The rope stuck to the wire would then come to them. He would proceed
    to attach the pulley to the gas-can gondola with the detonation
    device and thread the rope through it. Then he would stretch the rope
    taut with one swift motion and secure it to a tree. Then the rest
    is...party time, dude. Have fun! Here we go! Make it happen!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    they had done some damage to the school's computer, or its electrical
    current or wiring, Sakamochi's staff would suspect a system failure,
    no, given the power of explosives here once the entire computer...no,
    in fact half the school was blown up, then they would take the tire
    tubes they'd already hidden behind the rock in F-7 and run towards
    the western shore, escaping by sea as planned. If they could mislead
    the government by sending a false SOS signal using their transistor
    radio and get to the next island, Toyoshima, in less than a half an
    hour as calculated, then they would take a boat. (He had experience
    with a motor boat. He was really appreciating all the wisdom his late
    uncle had imparted.) Then they would probably escape into Okayama,
    hopefully landing on an obscure shore, and then they'd be fine. They
    could take a freight train heading to the countryside. Or they would
    furnish themselves with a car passing by. After all, he had a gun.
    Carjack. Nice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    looked down at the Beretta M92F tucked into his belt. He was planning
    on slipping through by misleading the government, but just in case
    they were found at sea, he'd filled several Coke bottles with his
    special ammonium nitrate-gasoline mixture and stuffed them into his
    day pack. But without a detonator they were basically just Molotov
    cocktails. If they were detected, it would be best to swim toward the
    guard ship and get on board to fight. If all went well they could get
    their hands on the enemy's weapons, and if they could operate the
    ship, it could provide their means of escape. But he would have to be
    a good shot to accomplish this.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was a little concerned. He'd been running all over the island with
    his Beretta, but come to think of it, he hadn't fired it once. And
    even his uncle didn't have a gun, so he'd never learned how to use
    one.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shinji shook his head. The Third Man, Shinji Mimura. No prob. The
    first time he held a heavy basketball and tossed a free throw, the
    ball swooped right through the basket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji.&quot;
    Yutaka called him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    looked up. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No...&quot;
    Yutaka said pitifully. And then he nervously wrote something on the
    memo pad.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    read it under the moonlight by the window. It read, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>I</b></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i><b>can't
    find the pulley.</b></i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    glanced at Yutaka. For all he knew he might look really mad. Yutaka
    suddenly drew back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    was in charge of half of the rope supply and the pulley. Ever since
    Shinji took the pulley from the well, Yutaka had been in charge of
    it, bringing it over here and putting it somewhere.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    put his bundles of rope and day pack down again. He began searching
    the area on his knees.&nbsp;Yutaka did the same.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    groped in the dark, looking beyond the tractor and below the work
    desk, but they couldn't find it. Shinji stood up and checked his
    watch again. Instead of 12:10, it was approaching 12:15.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally,
    he decided to take out the flashlight from his day pack. He cupped
    the bulb area with his hands and turned it on.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    did his best not to let any light leak out, but the interior of the
    warehouselike pseudo farm coop glowed a faint yellow. Shinji saw
    Yutaka's worried face and then beyond his shoulder, he easily located
    the pulley, lying beyond the moonlight from the window on the floor
    by the plain wall behind the desk. It was less than a meter away from
    Yutaka's day pack on the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    signaled Yutaka and quickly turned off the flashlight. Yutaka
    snatched up the pulley.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    sorry, Shinji,&quot; Yutaka said apologetically.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    forced a grin, &quot;Get it together, Yutaka.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he shouldered the day pack and rope once again. He lifted the gas
    can. He was confident about his strength, but two of these items were
    pretty heavy. Carrying the rope would only be partway, but he would
    have to carry the twenty-kilogram gas can to the top of the mountain.
    And they had to hurry too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    carried his bundle of rope. The heavy load made him look like a
    tortoise weighed down by its shell. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Well,
    Shinji looked no different</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    he thought. They walked to the sliding door on the east side of the
    building. The door had been opened approximately ten centimeters,
    letting in a thin ray of pale blue moonlight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    so sorry, Shinji,&quot; Yutaka said again.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    all right. Don't worry. Let's just make sure we get it right from
    here on.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shifted the gas can to his left hand, put his right hand on the heavy
    steel door, and slid it open. The pale light spread out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Outside
    there was an unpaved parking lot. Its entrance was on the right. The
    farm coop faced a narrow road. Near its entrance was a station wagon.
    The wide longitudinal road traversing the island was slightly south
    of this road.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    front of the door, east of the parking lot, was a farm made up of
    several houses. Beyond that area was another cluster of houses, and
    even in the dark you could see them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To
    his left Shinji saw a small storage shack at the end of the property,
    and further on up was the school, and above it, as if it were
    embracing it, the cliff. There were some trees right by a two-story
    house in front of the school. They were planning on tying the rope to
    the tallest tree there. They had secured the wire near the farm's
    waterway immediately left of the tree. So the wire went by the school
    and directly up into the center of the mountain, where the
    overlooking rock was, covering an amazing distance of three hundred
    meters.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    can't believe I came up with this plan. I wonder though, whether that
    wire will really lift the rope up to the mountain without getting
    cut?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    took a breath and then after considering it, he decided to say
    something. It wouldn't matter whether they heard him say this.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yutaka.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    looked up at Shinji. &quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    might die. Are you prepared for that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    a moment Yutaka fell silent. But then he answered immediately, &quot;Yeah,
    I'm ready.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    gripped the handle of the gas can again and was about to form a
    smile. A smile that froze when he saw something in the corner of his
    eye.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Someone's
    head emerged from the farm east of the parking lot.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yutaka!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    grabbed Yutaka's arm and ran back behind the sliding door into the
    slate-walled farm coop building. Yutaka teetered for a moment,
    partially due to the heavy rope, but managed to follow him. By the
    time they were crouched over behind the sliding door, Shinji already
    had his gun aimed at the figure.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    figure shrieked, &quot;D-don't shoot! Shinji! Please don't shoot!
    It's me! Keita!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    realized it was Keita Iijima (Male Student No. 2). Keita, relatively
    speaking, was friendly and got along with Shinji and Yutaka (after
    all they'd been classmates since their first year), but Shinji wasn't
    relieved someone was joining them. No, he felt like this meant
    trouble. That's when he realized he hadn't given much thought to the
    possibility of others joining them until now. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Damn,
    why now!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    Keita, Shinji. Come on, it's Keita.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    thought Yutaka's excited voice sounded a little inappropriate.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita
    slowly stood up and proceeded toward the farm coop premises. He held
    his day pack in his left hand and what looked like a kitchen knife in
    his right. He spoke cautiously.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    saw the light.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    clenched his teeth. It must have come from the flashlight he'd used
    just that one time to find the pulley. Shinji chided himself, how
    could he have screwed up like that, rushing to use that flashlight?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita
    continued, &quot;So I came here and saw that it was you guys. What
    are you doing? What were you carrying? Rope? L-let me join you guys.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Knowing
    how their conversations were monitored, Yutaka knit his brow and
    looked over at Shinji, his eyes opened wide, realizing how Shinji
    hadn't lowered his gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sh-Shinji,
    what's going on?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    moved his open right hand and signaled Yutaka not to move forward.
    &quot;Yutaka. Don't move.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,&quot;
    Keita said. His voice was shaking. &quot;Why are you pointing that at
    me?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    took a deep breath and said to Keita, &quot;Don't move.&quot; He
    could tell Yutaka was getting tense.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita
    Iijima's pitiful face was visible in the moonlight as he took a step
    forward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why?
    Why won't you let me? Have you forgotten who I am, Shinji? Let me
    join you guys.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    cocked his gun with a click. Keita Iijima stopped. They still had
    plenty of distance, seven or eight meters.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    come near us,&quot; Shinji slowly repeated. &quot;I can't let you
    join.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    whined right beside him, &quot;Why, Shinji? We can trust Keita.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shook his head. Then he thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>there's
    something you don't know about us, Yutaka</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    wasn't a big deal. In fact it was a trivial incident.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    happened during their second year near the end of the term in March.
    Shinji went to Takamatsu to see a movie (there was no movie theater
    in Shiroiwa) with Keita Iijima. Yutaka was supposed to go too, but he
    had a cold that day.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was how Shinji encountered three tough-looking high school students
    in a back alley off the main street near the shopping arcade. Shinji
    and Keita had already seen the movie, and once they were done
    checking out the book and record stores (Shinji bought imported
    computer books. They were lucky finds. Even though they were
    technical books, the government strictly prohibited books from the
    West so they were difficult to come by), they were heading over to
    the train station when Keita realized he'd forgot to buy a comic book
    and went back to the bookstore alone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    you got any dough?&quot; one of the high school students asked. This
    guy was at least ten centimeters taller than Shinji, who at 172
    meters was short for a basketball player.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shrugged. &quot;I think I have 2,571 yen.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    interrogator looked at the other two as if saying, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>how
    lame</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Then he leaned over by Shinji's ear. Shinji was annoyed. Maybe it was
    from getting wasted on paint thinner or some wacky drug that was hip
    these days—in any case the guy's gums were receding, and the smell
    of his breath coming between his teeth reeked. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Brush
    your teeth, man.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    guy said, &quot;Give it up. Come on, now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    gave an exaggerated look of surprise and said, &quot;Oh, so you guys
    are homeless! You know you should be content with twenty yen then. I
    actually might give you something if you get on your knees and beg
    for forgiveness.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    guy with a gap in his teeth looked surprised while the other two
    grinned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    still in junior high, right? You should learn to respect your
    elders,&quot; the guy said and grabbed Shinji by the shoulder. He
    kneed Shinji in the stomach. Shinji tightened his stomach muscles to
    take the blow. It didn't hurt that much. It was just a threatening
    knee kick. These guys could never take on someone their own age.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    calmly pushed the high school student away. Then he said, &quot;What
    was that? A Russian hug?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    guys probably didn't even know where Russia was. But the guy with the
    gap in his teeth seemed irked by Shinji's tone of voice, and his
    thin, ugly face contorted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    it.&quot; He punched Shinji in the face. This also didn't hurt much,
    though the inside of Shinji's mouth got cut.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stuck his fingers in his mouth to check the wound. It stung a little.
    He pulled out his fingers and found blood on them. It was nothing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on, give us your wallet.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    looking down, Shinji broke into a grin. He looked up. When their eyes
    met the guy with the gap in his teeth looked intimidated.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    said playfully, &quot;You made the first move,&quot; and then with
    the motion of a short hook punch he swung the hardcover imported book
    in his hand into the guy's filthy mouth. He felt the guy's teeth
    break, his head fly back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    took ten seconds for the fight to end. Of course his uncle's
    teachings had included fighting lessons too. It was trivial.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What
    wasn't trivial was something else.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he glared at the passers by who were staring at the high school
    students on the ground, Shinji headed back to the book store and
    found Keita in the comics section. The book he went back for was
    already in a shopping bag. He seemed to be browsing aimlessly, and
    when Shinji called on him, he said, &quot;I'm sorry. I remembered
    there was another book I wanted.&quot; Then his eyes opened wide and
    he asked him, &quot;What happened to your mouth?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shrugged and said, &quot;Let's go home.&quot; He knew though that
    Keita had actually turned the street corner for a split second and
    ducked back when he saw Shinji surrounded by three high school
    students. Shinji had thought Keita might have gone to call the
    police. (Well, given how they were so occupied with the suppression
    of civilians instead of criminals they weren't all that dependable
    anyway.) </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh,
    so there was another book you wanted. I see.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thanks
    to this incident, the train ride back to Shiroiwa-cho wasn't much
    fun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita
    probably thought Shinji could take on three high school students
    without any problem. And he was right. Keita probably didn't want to
    get hurt by getting involved in the fight. And okay, Shinji could
    understand how the high school students might take note of Keita's
    face if he'd called the cops. Uh huh. And Keita had no intention of
    apologizing to Shinji. Sometimes you need to lie to make the world go
    around.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These
    things happen. As his uncle often used to say, cowards can't be
    faulted for being sly. They can't be held responsible for everything.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    the cover was torn on the technical book Shinji bought. On top of
    that, the edge was stained with the guy's saliva and dented by his
    teeth. That really got Shinji. Every time he'd open that book he'd
    have to recall that annoying face. On top of that, and he might be
    called anal retentive for this, but he hated it when his books were
    torn or dirty. He always put covers on them when he read them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    uncle also said this. When you can't accept the results, then you
    have to punish whoever was responsible for them. Even the score.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    from then on as a form of punishment Shinji decided to keep his
    distance from Keita. It wasn't such a severe punishment. After all,
    it wasn't like he decided they were enemies. They were both better
    off this way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    it was a trivial story. And he'd never shared the incident with
    Yutaka.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    maybe trivializing a story like that one could get you killed in this
    game. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>This
    isn't revenge, Uncle. This is what you'd call the real world. I
    simply can't be friends with him.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right.&quot; In response to Yutaka's statement, Keita Iijima spread
    his arms. The kitchen knife in his right hand reflected the
    moonlight. &quot;I thought we were friends.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    still refused to lower the muzzle of his gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Seeing
    how adamant Shinji was, Keita looked like he was about to burst into
    tears. He threw the kitchen knife onto the ground. &quot;See? I don't
    want to fight. Do you see now?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    shook his head. &quot;No. Scram.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita's
    face flushed with anger. &quot;Why? Why won't you trust me?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shut
    up, Yutaka.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita's
    face froze. He turned quiet...and then said, his voice trembling, &quot;Is
    it because of what I did that time, Shinji? When I ran off? Is that
    why you don't trust me, Shinji?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    aimed the gun at him without a word.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji!&quot;
    Keita's voice once again turned pathetic. He was practically sobbing,
    &quot;I'm sorry about that Shinji. I'm so sorry, Shinji—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji's
    lips tightened. He wondered whether Keita was being sincere or
    whether he putting on an act. But then he dismissed the thought. I</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>'m
    not alone. I can't risk Yutaka's life too.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    There was an aphorism he'd heard claimed by a Defense Minister of
    some nation, &quot;We must defend ourselves according to our
    opponents' ability, not their intentions.&quot; They were approaching
    1 a.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji,
    what is going on—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    held Yutaka back with his right hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita
    proceeded forward. &quot;Please. I'm so scared. Please let me join.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    come any closer!&quot; Shinji shouted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keita
    Iijima shook his sad face left and right and stepped out. He was
    approaching Shinji and Yutaka.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    pointed the gun downward and pulled the trigger for the first time.
    The shell popping out of the Beretta traced a pale white arc in the
    moonlight and a cloud of dust rose in front Keita's feet. Keita
    stared at it as if it were some rare chemistry experiment.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then he started walking again.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop!
    Just stop!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Please
    let me join. Please.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Like
    a wind-up doll Keita stepped forward. Right, left, right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    clenched his teeth. If Keita was going to pull out something besides
    his knife, it would have to come from his right arm.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Of

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    split second before the popping sound, Shinji suddenly realized that
    he was sweating. He was sweating from the tension.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    happened so suddenly. Keita Iijima bent over as if his upper body had
    been punched in. He spread out his arms like a shotputter does right
    before throwing a shot, then bent his knees and fell on his back.
    Even in the dark Shinji could clearly see the blood spurting out of
    the hole in the right side of his chest like a small fountain. This
    was also instantaneous.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji!
    What'd you do!&quot; Yutaka screamed and ran to Keita. He knelt
    beside him and put his hands on Keita's body, his mouth agape. Then
    after hesitating for a moment he touched his neck. His face went
    pale. &quot;He's dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    remained frozen, still holding onto his gun. He felt like he wasn't
    thinking, but he was. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    lame</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    the voice echoed in his head. Although it was irrelevant, the voice
    echoed the way it does when you talk to yourself in the shower.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    lame. I thought you were supposed to be The Third Man, Shinji Mimura,

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    stood up and began to walk forward. As if he'd suddenly turned into a
    cyborg, his body felt heavy. One day Shinji Mimura woke up to find
    out that he had become the Terminator. Great.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    slowly walked over to Keita Iijima's body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    glared back at Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why,
    Shinji! Why'd you kill him!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Standing
    motionless, Shinji answered, &quot;I thought we'd be in trouble if
    Keita had another weapon besides the knife. I aimed for his arm. I
    didn't mean to kill him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hearing
    this, Yutaka checked Keita Iijima's body. As if to make a point, he
    looked through Keita's day pack too. Then he said, &quot;He had
    nothing! How could you, Shinji!? Why didn't you trust him!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    suddenly felt hollow. But it was necessary. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hey,
    Uncle, I didn't do anything wrong, did I? Right?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    looked down at Yutaka without saying a word. But—yes, no matter
    what—they had to hurry. They couldn't let their mistakes drag them
    down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    before he was about to say this, something changed in Yutaka's face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    lips trembled. He said, &quot;Oh no, Shinji, don't tell me you—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    had no idea what he was referring to. He asked, &quot;What?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    quickly stepped back. He distanced himself from Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    spoke through his trembling lips, &quot;Shinji, you didn't do that on
    purpose...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji's
    lips tightened. He gripped the Beretta in his left hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You're
    saying I shot Keita to buy us time? That's—&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    frantically shook his head. Then he slowly retreated. &quot;No, no.
    This whole plan—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    knit his brows and stared at Yutaka. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Yutaka,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    still didn't make any sense, but Shinji whose brain's CPU was

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    what else could it be?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    was accusing Shinji of having no intention whatsoever to escape, that
    he had been planning all along to &quot;play&quot; this game. That's
    why he shot Keita.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji's
    face gave a look of absolute dismay. His mouth might have been
    hanging open for all he knew.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he shouted, &quot;Don't be stupid! Why the hell would I be with you
    then!?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    was trembling, shaking his head. &quot;Tha-that's...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    didn't say anymore, but Shinji understood that too. He probably
    wanted to say that Shinji was using him to survive, for instance by
    having him keep watch so Shinji could sleep.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But

    to gain your trust and that my hidden intention was to use the
    gasoline and fertilizer to protect myself and win the game. That
    since I only had one gun, a special explosive would come in handy to
    survive in this game? That right before executing the plan to bomb

    fatigue.</i></font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That's
    what Shinji thought on a rational level. And if he could have gone
    through each explanation step by step then Yutaka would have realized
    how foolish every one of his suspicions were. In fact, everything
    Shinji could come up with might not have corresponded to Yutaka's
    suspicions. It might have been a simple case of fatigue combined with
    the shock of witnessing his close friend die suddenly giving way to a
    suspicion lurking somewhere in the back of Yutaka's mind. But it came
    to surface because it had been there in the first place, his
    suspicion towards Shinji. And the thought of suspecting Yutaka had
    never even occurred to Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All
    of a sudden, the exhaustion he felt was overpowering. A horizontal

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    uncocked the Beretta and tossed it over to Yutaka. Yutaka hesitated
    but received it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Emptied
    out, Shinji threw his hands onto his knees.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;If
    you don't trust me then shoot me, Yutaka. I don't care, just shoot
    me.&quot; Crouching, Shinji continued, &quot;I shot Keita to protect
    you, Yutaka. Damn.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    suddenly looked at him blankly. Then ready to burst into tears, he
    uttered, &quot;Oh...oh...&quot; He ran to Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    put his hand on Shinji's shoulder and began sobbing out loud. Shinji
    stared down at the ground with his hands on his knees. He realized
    his eyes too were filled with tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Somewhere
    in the back of his mind, he was telling himself, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hey
    hey, don't you have more urgent matters to attend to? Look how
    vulnerable you guys are bickering like this. Have you forgotten,

    you're out of time...</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">the
    voice resembled his uncle's.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shinji's nerves were too worn out, his body too tired, and emotions
    too rattled from Yutaka's suspicion against him to take heed of this
    warning.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    merely cried. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Yutaka.
    I was trying to protect you. How could you suspect me? I trusted
    you...but then again, maybe Keita Iijima felt the same way. How
    horrible to be suspected by someone you trust. I did an awful thing.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Amidst
    these worn out emotions of sadness, exhaustion, and regret, Shinji
    heard a rattling that sounded like the tapping of an old typewriter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    split second later, he felt as if burnt tongs were poking through his
    body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    wounds were fatal by then, but the pain made Shinji come to his
    senses. Yutaka, who had his hand on Shinji's shoulder, fell to the
    ground. Over at the far end of the farm coop parking lot was a figure
    in a school coat. He held a gun—something bigger than a pistol. It
    looked more like a tin box. Shinji realized he'd been shot—</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>of
    course with bullets, damn</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">—with
    bullets that had exited through Yutaka's body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    body felt hot and stiff—</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
    guy just lanced me with lead bullets, duh</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">—but
    Shinji reflexively fell to his left and picked up the Beretta Yutaka
    had taken and dropped. He aimed it at the figure, Kazuo Kiriyama
    (Male Student No. 6) and fired several times at his stomach.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    Kiriyama shifted to the right before the shots got to him, though.
    Then along with the rattling sound, the tips of his hands flashed
    like out-of-season fireworks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    blows he felt in the right side of his stomach, his left shoulder,
    and chest were much worse than the one he'd just felt a moment ago.
    The Beretta fell from his hand.&nbsp;But by then Shinji had already
    begun running toward the farm coop. He staggered for a moment, but
    then crouched down and dashed off, leaping through the sliding door
    head first. A stream of bullets chased after him and right when
    Shinji thought he'd escaped them, it managed to blow off the tip of
    his right foot's basketball sneaker. This time Shinji grimaced in
    agony from the pain shooting through his body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    he had no time to rest. He grabbed the gas can in the shadow of the
    sliding door and retreated&nbsp;through the dark where the tractor
    and combine harvester were, practically crawling on his left arm and
    left leg. He dragged the gas can with his right hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Blood
    was pouring out of his mouth. There were at least ten bullets in his
    body. And despite the sharp pain that shot up from his right foot he
    managed to glance at the vanished tip of his basketball shoes and
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    guess I can't play ball anymore. Impossible now. Even if I could I'll
    never be in the starting lineup. So much for my basketball career.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shinji was more concerned about Yutaka. Could he still be alive?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Kazuo</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">—Shinji
    coughed up blood as he clenched his teeth—</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>so
    you've decided to play the game, you bastard. Then come after me.
    Yutaka can't move, but I can. You can take care of Yutaka later.
    First come after me. Come on, come after me.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if responding to his wish, Shinji could see from underneath the
    tractor a figure in the blue pale belt of light coming in through the
    sliding door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    along with the rattling sound, lights flashed like camera flashes,
    and bullets scattered across the building. A part of some farm
    equipment was blown to bits, and the window across from him was
    smashed into fragments.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    stopped. He was out of bullets. But Kazuo would reload another
    magazine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    grabbed a screwdriver near him and tossed it to his left. It made a
    clanging sound and tapped onto the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    thought Kazuo would shoot over there, but instead he scattered
    bullets across in an arc around the screwdriver. Shinji ducked,
    praying he wouldn't be hit. The shooting stopped again. Shinji looked
    up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    he could tell Kazuo was inside the building.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That's
    right</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Shinji's blood-drenched lips formed a smile. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    over here. Come over here—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    lifted the gas can with his right hand and placed it on his stomach.
    He moved back again with his left arm and left leg, trying his best
    not to make any sound. His back hit a hard, boxlike object, and he
    slid around it as he continued to retreat. His movements weren't
    completely silent. Kazuo already knew he was hiding somewhere in the
    dark here. The blood dripping out of him was a dead giveaway.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    crouched down and checked under various farm tools and the pickup
    truck as he approached Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    surveyed the area. He could barely make out the outline of the upper
    floor on the opposite side of the building as well as the steel
    stairs that led up there from the door. If his body was in adequate
    condition he could have jumped on him from up there. But that wasn't
    possible anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a cart on the east wall. It was a pushcart with four small wheels
    used to carry equipment. The office in the corner with partitions was
    beyond the pushcart and next to it was an exit. The sliding door, if
    fully opened, was large enough for a car, but this one was only for
    people. The door was shut.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>That
    door...I locked it along with the other windows and every other door.
    How long would it take me to unlock it?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    had no time to think it over. Shinji dragged his body over to the
    pushcart. Once he was there he placed the gas can on it. He opened
    its lid. He pushed in the rubber object dangling from a plastic cord.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    took out the detonation device in his pocket. His fingers were
    clumsy—probably due to his wounds—but they finally managed to
    peel off the tape on the side of the battery, revealing an exposed
    wire dangling from the detonator tube. Shinji connected it to the
    wire tip of the condenser circuit. He pulled off the insulation of
    the battery case. As he heard a faint, high hum from the rapid charge
    of the condenser, he quickly peeled off the tape on the charge device
    switch and shoved the detonator tube deep inside the gas can's rubber
    cap. He left the rest of the unit, including the charge device, the
    battery case, and circuit, on top of the gas can. He had no time to
    secure it. He could see Kazuo's feet to the right of the threshing
    machine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    chances were slim. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But
    now that Yutaka and me are injured, there's no way we'll ever make it
    up the mountain. Sohere's a special something for you, Kazuo.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    kicked the pushcart with his left leg as hard as he could. As the
    cart skimmed by the other equipment, Shinji leaped for the exit door
    without even checking to see if the cart was heading towards Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    unlocked it in 0.2 seconds. He even utilized his right leg with its
    missing foot tip to crash through the door and leap out of the
    building.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    slate walls of the farm coop behind him suddenly burst with an
    explosion that shook the entire dark island. The sound of Kazuo's
    hand grenade that had temporarily disabled Shuya's hearing was
    nothing compared to this explosion. Shinji realized, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>whoa,
    there go my eardrums.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    body slid on the ground from the blast of the explosion, scraping off
    the skin on his forehead. Fragments and scraps blew by. Still, Shinji
    managed to look back quickly and see, right where the building's wall
    should be, the light truck floating in the air upside down. Probably
    due to its raised position from the jack, the blast had slammed it
    with incredible pressure, blowing it upwards. It spun around slowly
    in air filled with fragments of glass, slate, and concrete (he felt
    as if they were also stuck into his body too, but the ones he saw now
    didn't come flying out directly, but were blown up into the sky),
    traced an exaggerated arc, and crashed on its side in the middle of
    the parking lot. It rolled over another ninety degrees and stopped,
    completely upside down. The back carriage was nearly torn off,
    twisted up like a wrung out rag, and the wheel with a missing tire
    somehow managed to still spin around and around.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fragments
    continued showering down. Immersed in clouds of smoke the farm coop
    was now reduced to only its frame. The only wall remaining was part
    of the one on the north side, along with the upper floor. But the
    upper floor was completely exposed behind the smoke. The south side
    of the roof was completely blown away, and the machines, including
    the farm equipment, were scattered around on their sides. Even in the
    dark Shinji could tell they were burnt black. He saw several bright
    flames. Maybe something was on fire. The side exit Shinji used to
    escape through was barely connected to the remains of the wall by the
    bottom hinges, bent over his way, as if bowing. The office with
    partitions had completely vanished without a trace. Well, actually
    there was the office desk still hanging on, glued to the part of the
    wall that escaped destruction, pushed from behind by the combine
    harvester that was also probably blown away by the explosion.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    must have been blown up high in the sky because, completely out of
    sync with the other debris, it was finally landing somewhere in the
    smoke with a high metallic ring. Although Shinji could hardly hear
    it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Next
    thing he knew, Shinji was struggling to get up from the debris of
    wall and other materials, staring at the ruins of the building. He
    gasped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes,
    the handmade gasoline can bomb was well made. With that kind of
    destructive force it would have certainly annihilated the school.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    that was all over now. The important thing now was that he'd defeated
    the enemy coming after him. And even more urgent was—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yutaka.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    mumbled as he finally got up, kneeling on his right knee on the
    debris. The moment he opened his mouth, blood came gushing out
    between his teeth, and he felt an incredible surge of pain running
    from his chest down to his stomach. It was a miracle he was still
    alive. But he stretched out his arms and put his right leg down on
    its heel and then stretched out his left leg and somehow managed to
    stand up. Shinji looked over to the edge of the parking lot where
    Yutaka was lying&nbsp;when he saw the overturned light truck's
    door—it must have been busted—open with a dull creaking sound.
    (He could hear it faintly. Some of his hearing seemed to be coming
    back.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    Kiriyama stepped down onto the ground. He held the tin-box-like
    machine gun in his right hand as if nothing had happened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hey—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    felt like he should burst out laughing. For all he knew his
    blood-soaked lips might have even formed a smile.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>You
    gotta be kidding.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    then Kazuo fired. Shinji this time met a full frontal parabolic
    shower of 9mm bullets and staggered back into the ground covered with
    debris. Something was pressing into his back. As of now there really
    was no need to check it, but he thought it was the front of the
    parked station wagon. The station wagon had also been blown up by the
    blast, its back stuck into a wooden telephone pole now lopsided from
    the impact. Another object seemed to have smashed into its
    windshield, which resembled a spider's web.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Surrounded
    by the bright flames burning in the building, Kazuo calmly stood
    still. Then beyond him Shinji saw Yutaka lying on his face, half
    buried in the debris. Right near him was Keita Iijima lying on his
    back, his face staring at Shinji.</font></font></p>

    Kiriyama's Ingram burst out once again and Shinji's thoughts came to
    an end. The bullets had torn apart his cerebral cortex. Near his
    head, the cracked front windshield was now shattered, most of its
    fragments sliding into the car, but some of the finer mistlike
    particles fell on Shinji's body already covered with dust and debris.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    slowly fell forward on his face. Debris bounced up on impact. It took
    less than thirty seconds for the rest of his body besides his brain
    to die. The memento of his beloved uncle—the earring worn by the
    woman he loved—was now stained in blood running down Shinji's left
    ear, reflecting the glow from the building now consumed in red
    flames.</font></font></p>

    the bushes with her blanket over her shoulders, Noriko hugged her
    knees and stared at the ground. It was still very dark and insects
    were humming the way a fluorescent light sputters out before it dies.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi's
    midnight announcement came on right after they reached this area. He
    announced the death of Hirono Shimizu (Female Student No. 10), who
    had—although Noriko herself didn't see it—killed Kaori Minami and
    fled from Shuya, followed by the addition of three forbidden zones.
    At 1 a.m. F-7, at 3 a.m. G-3, and at 5 a.m. E-4. Noriko and Shogo's
    sector, C-3, was still safe. Shuya's name wasn't mentioned, but...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ten
    to twenty minutes later, there was distant gunfire again and then the
    sound of that machine gun. Noriko's heart froze. The sound continued.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    couldn't forget it. It was unmistakable—the sound of Kazuo
    Kiriyama's machine gun. Unless someone else had the same gun.
    Regardless, the sound was enough to make her wonder whether Kazuo had
    finally caught up to Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    Noriko could mention this to Shogo though, there was an incredible
    explosion. The hand grenade they encountered when they were fighting
    Kiriyama was nothing compared to this. And then there was the faint
    sound of the machine gun, once or twice. After that the island
    returned to silence.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even
    Shogo seemed surprised by the sound. He was carving an arrow-like
    object with his knife when he suddenly stopped and said, &quot;I'm
    going to go have a look. Don't move,&quot; and walked out of the
    bushes. He came back immediately and told her, &quot;A building's on
    fire on the east side.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    started to ask, &quot;Could it be—&quot; but Shogo shook his head
    and said, &quot;It's quite a ways south from where Kiriyama was.
    Shuya escaped into the mountainside, so it can't be him. Let's wait
    for him here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    felt relieved for the time being. But nearly an entire hour had
    passed since then. Shuya still hadn't returned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    held her wrist under the coin-sized moonlight coming through the
    branches and checked her watch. It was 1:12 a.m. She'd been repeating
    this gesture as if it were a magical ritual.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she buried her head between her knees.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    horrible image flashed by in her thoughts. Shuya's face. His mouth
    half-open and eyes looking off into the distance, the way he looked
    singing a song called &quot;Imagine&quot; (Shuya said it was a rock
    standard) during one of their breaks in the music room, out of the
    teacher's sight. But this face had a large, black dot similar to one
    worn by a Hindu worshipper. Without warning, red liquid came oozing
    out of the dot. The large dot was in fact a very dark and deep hole.
    The blood poured out from his brain, covering his face...like cracks
    running through a piece of glass.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    shivered and shook her head, dismissing the thought. She looked up at
    Shogo, who was leaning against a tree trunk, smoking a cigarette.
    There was a handmade bow next to him and several arrows stuck in the
    ground.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked like a silhouette in the dark. He removed the cigarette from
    his mouth and rested his right wrist on his upright knee.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya
    should be here by now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    put his cigarette in his mouth again. Its tip reddened, faintly
    lighting up his calm face. Noriko felt impatient. His face darkened
    again and smoke drifted out of his mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    calm tone also irritated her. But then she reminded herself how he'd
    saved her and Shuya several times over, so she restrained herself.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Something
    must have happened.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Probably.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    do you mean, 'probably'?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    silhouette raised its arms. The lit cigarette moved. &quot;Calm down.
    That was definitely Kazuo's machine gun. Unless they supplied an
    identical machine gun to someone else. And given how the explosion
    occurred over there, it means that Kazuo was fighting someone besides
    Shuya. Shuya escaped from Kazuo. I know that much.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    then why isn't he—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    interrupted, &quot;He's probably hiding somewhere. Or he might have
    gotten lost.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    shook her head. &quot;He might be hurt. Or even worse...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    felt a chill run down her spine. She couldn't continue. The image of
    Shuya with the red spider-web face and half-open mouth flashed by
    again. Shuya might have escaped from Kazuo, but he might have been
    severely wounded, he might be dying right now. Even if that wasn't
    the case, what if he was attacked by someone while he was running
    through the mountains... or what if he fell unconscious somewhere,
    and what if that was in a forbidden zone, then Shuya would end up
    dead. Shuya might have run into the base of the northern mountain
    which was in sector F-7, directly north of the school, sector F-7
    which was a forbidden zone as of 1 a.m. And now it was past 1 a.m.,
    which meant...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    shook her head again. That couldn't be. Shuya couldn't die.
    Because...Shuya was like a holy man with a guitar. He was always kind
    to everyone, he was always so sympathetic to the sorrows of others,
    but he would never lose that powerful smile, he was so upright and
    transparent and innocent but also tough. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He's
    like my guardian angel. How could someone like that die? There's no
    way he could...but still...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    quietly said, &quot;He might be, he might not be.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    turned her wrist and nervously checked her watch again. She moved her
    leg painfully and sidled up to Shogo. She squeezed Shogo's left hand,
    which was on his knees, with both hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Please.
    Can't we go. Can't we go look for him? Will you come with me? I can't
    do this on my own. Please.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    said nothing. He only lifted his left hand slowly, returning Noriko's
    hands to her thighs, and tapped them lightly. &quot;We can't. Even if
    you insist on going alone, I won't let you. Shuya wanted me to look
    after you. He took a big risk making us leave before him. I don't
    want to jeopardize all he did for us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    bit her lower lip and stared at him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    give me that look. You're making this hard on me.&quot; Shogo
    scratched his head with his hand holding his cigarette and said, &quot;You
    care about Shuya, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    nodded. She didn't hesitate.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    nodded back and said, &quot;Then let's respect his wishes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    bit her lip again, but then looked down and nodded. &quot;All right.
    We can only wait, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were silent for a while but then he asked, &quot;Do you believe in
    sixth sense?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    topic was so unexpected Noriko widened her eyes. Was he trying to
    distract her?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    a little. I don't really know though,&quot; she responded. &quot;Do
    you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    crushed his cigarette into the ground. Then he said, &quot;Absolutely
    not...well, I don't think it matters either way. All that stuff about
    ghosts, the afterlife, cosmic power, sixth sense, fortune telling,
    psychic powers—that's just the talk of fools who can only deal with
    reality by avoiding it. I'm sorry. You said you believed a little.
    That's just my opinion. But—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    looked at his eyes. &quot;But?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    sometimes without any apparent reason I'm certain about things I
    can't know for sure. And for some reason I've never been wrong when
    this happens.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    remained silent and stared at him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    said, &quot;Shuya's still alive. He'll be back. I know it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    face suddenly relaxed. He might have been making this up on the spot,
    but even so she was touched he made the effort.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Thanks,&quot;
    she said, &quot;You're kind, Shogo.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    shrugged. &quot;I'm just telling you how I feel.&quot; Then he said,
    &quot;Shuya's a lucky guy.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    looked over at him. &quot;Hm?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Lucky
    that someone loves him this much.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    smiled just a little. &quot;You got it wrong.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    unrequited. Shuya likes someone else. I'm nothing compared to her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    looked down and nodded. &quot;She's really awesome. I don't know how
    to describe her. She's so strong and beautiful. I'm jealous, but I
    can understand why he's attracted to her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    tilted his head and said, &quot;I don't know.&quot; He flicked his

    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;When

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    smiled a little again.</font></font></p>

    blew out smoke. &quot;Now lie down. You haven't fully recovered yet.
    Once you're drowsy, get some sleep. I'll stay up all night. If Shuya

    were climbing a staircase. Now only twenty were left—no, as far as
    Hiroki knew, the number was down to seventeen. It was hard to
    believe, but Shinji Mimura was dead, along with Yutaka Seto and Keita
    Iijima.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    he left Shuya's group at the clinic, Hiroki headed towards the
    island's northwest shore, which he'd never checked out. Then a little
    past 11 p.m. he heard heavy gunfire and moved back east of the
    island's central area in pursuit of the sound. But the noise stopped
    before he got there, so he couldn't find anything. Then the midnight
    announcement came, and the additional forbidden zones were announced.
    Hiroki decided to comb through each of those zones. As he was
    entering the north side of the school, sector F-7, which would be
    forbidden at 1 a.m., he heard a gunshot and then...that machine gun
    sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because
    he was in the mountain, looking over the flat area, Hiroki saw a
    repeating flash—what seemed like a muzzle flashing in the farm
    immediately west of the housing area. As he descended the slope he
    heard an ear-shattering explosion. The night sky above the trees lit
    up. Then he heard the rattling sound again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he left the foot of the mountain, he saw a building on fire where the
    light had been flashing. Hiroki thought the assailant with the
    machine gun might still be there, but as he'd done with Megumi Eto,
    he had to find out what happened. He cautiously wove his way through
    the farm, approaching the area where&nbsp;he found the body of Shinji
    Mimura. The area was flickering with flames. The warehouse
    building—that must have been what exploded—was blown apart. Large
    and small debris were scattered all over what appeared to be a
    parking lot. Shinji was lying face down in front of a station wagon
    in the lot. His body was riddled with bullets. Later Hiroki found the
    bodies of Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima in the debris.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was no trace of the assailant with the machine gun, but Hiroki
    thought it was likely someone who was &quot;playing the game&quot;
    would show up soon, so he quickly left the area.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was only after he'd crossed the island's latitudinal road and entered
    the base of the southern mountain that he thought about Shinji, the
    death of </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>the</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Shinji Mimura. There was something unbelievable about it, since
    Hiroki knew him pretty well. It sounded offensive now, but he'd
    always thought Shinji was immortal. Hiroki went to the town martial
    arts school and learned martial arts, but that in the end was just a
    matter of technique. It was nothing against Shinji's inborn athletic
    prowess. Even if they'd fought according to martial arts rules, and
    even though Hiroki was ten centimeters taller, Shinji would have
    easily defeated him in a match. Besides, Shinji was much smarter than
    him. Even if Shinji couldn't escape the game (although it was likely
    he'd considered it), Hiroki firmly believed no one else would be able
    to kill Shinji. And yet the machine gun shooter somehow managed to do
    just that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    couldn't afford to mourn over Shinji, though. What mattered now was
    finding Kayoko Kotohiki. He had to find her soon—if the machine gun
    shooter found her, someone like Kotohiki would get instantly killed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since
    sector G-3, forbidden at 3 a.m., was on the northern side of the
    southern mountain peak, Hiroki decided to head over there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    already entered this mountain several times now. Takako Chigusa's
    body was still lying in sector H-4 in the region right before sector
    G-3. He couldn't even bury her body. He'd only managed to close her
    eyes and cross her arms over her chest. Her body was still outside
    the forbidden zone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he cautiously moved forward through the darkness, Hiroki thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    so awful</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    He wasn't even able to stay by his closest childhood friend. He'd
    probably be walking by her as he headed towards sector G-3.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    so sorry, Takako. I still need to take care of something. Right now I
    just have to see Kayoko Kotohiki. Please forgive me...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    something else occurred to him. It concerned Yutaka Seto.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka's
    seating number immediately followed his, so Yutaka had exited right
    after Hiroki. But Hiroki was still in the middle of checking out the
    premises, frantically searching for a hiding place that gave him a
    clear look at the school exit, so Yutaka was gone by the time he
    could afford to look back. Hiroki decided Takako would be his
    priority, and so he let Haruka Tanizawa (Female Student No. 12) and
    Yuichiro Takiguchi (Male Student No. 13) pass by. (But in spite of
    his extreme caution, Yoshio Akamatsu's surprise appearance had made
    him panic enough to lose Takako.) Yutaka had managed to join up with
    his friends Shinji Mimura and Keita Iijima. But Yutaka was now dead
    along with Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    have to hurry</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    he thought. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    can't let Kotohiki die.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    stopped by a bare tree and checked the radar in his left hand again.
    With the moon providing the only source of light, the unlit liquid
    crystal display was difficult to read, but by squinting his eyes he
    found he could make out faint traces of the crystal particles.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nothing
    changed on the screen, though. There was only the star mark
    indicating his position. Hiroki sighed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    he should just shout for Kotohiki. Hiroki had considered doing this
    several times, but then decided against it. When he found Takako, it
    had been too late. He didn't want that to happen again.&nbsp;No. It
    wouldn't work. He couldn't. First of all, Kotohiki wouldn't
    necessarily respond to his call. In fact, she might run away.
    Furthermore, although he didn't care about someone coming after him
    once he called for her, if Kotohiki were to come at the same time she
    might end up getting attacked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the end, he could only rely on the government-supplied radar. And
    without this equipment, he would have been even worse off. He
    absolutely despised the government for throwing them into this stupid
    game, but he had to admit he benefited from his equipment. What's
    this called? A stroke of luck in hard times? Or more like, a light in
    a tunnel of fury?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    went up and down a low cliff covered in bushes and came out onto a
    gentle slope scattered with trees. He knew he was entering sector
    H-4, where Takako was resting in peace. Hiroki raised the radar,
    moving it slightly to catch the moonlight on the crystal display.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    saw a blurred double image of the star mark indicating his position
    at the center of the display. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    no, I'm getting tired. Even my vision's going now.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    was still looking down when he realized he was wrong. At the same
    time, he turned around and swung his stick in his right hand.
    Following the martial arts technique he had learned so thoroughly,
    his elegant swing traced a graceful arc.&nbsp;The stick impressively
    landed on the arm of the figure standing behind him. The person
    groaned and dropped the object, a gun, in their hand. Someone had
    snuck up behind him when his guard was down for that brief moment.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    figure made a dash for the gun on the ground. Hiroki thrust the stick
    out in front of him. The figure froze and then staggered back—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    saw it. First, it was only the sailor suit. Then the beautiful face,
    brightly lit by the moon—angelic—it was unmistakably hers. It was
    right after he left the school, when he still hadn't managed to find
    a hiding place. Hiroki had been lurking in the corner of the athletic
    field when he saw the face of Mitsuko Souma (Female Student No. 11)
    as she emerged from the school building after him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    lifted both of her hands and stepped back. &quot;Please don't kill
    me! Please don't kill me!&quot; she shouted. She staggered and fell
    on her behind, revealing her white legs up beyond her thighs under
    her pleated skirt. She continued coquettishly to move back in the
    pale blue moonlight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Please!
    I was just trying to talk to you! I wouldn't think of killing anyone!
    Please help me! Help me!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    looked down at her without saying a word.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    she'd taken his silence to be a sign he meant no harm. Mitsuko slowly
    lowered her hands. Her eyes had the intimidated look of a terrified
    mouse, and tears were gleaming in them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    believe me, don't you?&quot; she said. A ray of moonlight fell on her
    tearstained face. Her eyes were faintly smiling. Of course, it wasn't
    the proud victorious smile of deception, but a smile brimming with
    relief that she felt deep in her heart.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I-I...&quot;
    she said but then pulled on her skirt with her left hand as if she'd
    finally realized her thighs were&nbsp;exposed. &quot;I thought I
    could trust you. I've been so scared, all alone...This is so awful,
    I'm just so terrified.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    saying a word, Hiroki picked up the gun Mitsuko had dropped. He saw
    it was cocked, so he uncocked the hammer with one hand and walked
    over to Mitsuko. He offered her the handle of the gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Th-thank
    you...&quot; Mitsuko reached out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    the gun froze.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    flipped it around with his hand. Now the muzzle was pointed right
    between her brows.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;W-what
    are you doing, Hiroki?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko's
    face was twisted with dismay and horror—at the very least it looked
    contorted. She was priceless. It wouldn't matter how many sordid
    rumors you heard about Mitsuko Souma, most people (particularly guys)
    would have to believe her once this angelic face of hers pleaded for
    mercy. No, even if you didn't believe her, you'd still end up doing
    anything you could for her. By no means was Hiroki an exception.
    Still, he had special circumstances.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Forget
    it, Mitsuko,&quot; Hiroki said. He held the gun and stood upright. &quot;I
    saw Takako right before she died.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    looked up at him, her perfectly shaped eyes trembling. Even if inside
    she was regretting not having finished Takako off, she gave no
    indication whatsoever of any regret. She just maintained that
    terrified look...a look seeking understanding and protection.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;N-no!
    That was an accident. Sure, I saw some of the others. But, when I
    encountered Takako...it was her! Sh-she tried to kill me. That gun's
    really Takako's...s-so I...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    recocked the Colt .45 with a click. Mitsuko's eyes squinted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know Takako. Takako would never try to kill someone, nor would she
    ever panic and go on a shooting spree. Even in this stupid game,&quot;
    Hiroki said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    tucked in her chin. She looked up at Hiroki and formed a smile. While
    it sent chills down his spine, it was precisely then that Mitsuko
    looked even more beautiful.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ha,&quot;
    she faintly laughed. &quot;I thought she died instantly,&quot; she
    said.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    didn't respond and kept pointing the gun at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    sitting, Mitsuko pinched the edge of her skirt with her left thumb
    and index finger, pulling it back slowly, once again revealing those
    enticing legs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    looked up.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    about it? If you help me, you can do what you like with me. I'm not
    bad, you know.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    remained frozen, holding the gun. He examined her face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    guess not,&quot; Mitsuko said. She said lightly, &quot;Of course not.
    I mean I'd kill you the moment you let down your guard. Besides, how
    could you sleep with the girl who killed your girlfriend—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;She's
    not my girlfriend.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    looked at Hiroki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    she was my best friend.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh
    really?&quot; Mitsuko raised her brow. Then she asked, &quot;Why
    won't you shoot me then? Is it because you're some kind of feminist?
    Can't shoot women?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    supremely confident face was still beautiful. It was totally
    different from Takako's, who had the graceful beauty of a war goddess
    in Greek or Roman myth. Here we had a teenage sorceress. She's
    charming, innocent, angelic, yet completely frigid. Under the
    moonlight, her eyes were like gleaming ice. Hiroki felt dizzy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How—&quot;
    He could tell his voice was hoarse. &quot;How could you kill someone
    so easily?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    fool,&quot; Mitsuko said. She sounded as if she could care less about
    the gun pointed at her forehead. &quot;Those are the rules.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    squinted and shook his head. &quot;Not everyone's playing by them.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    tilted her head again. Then she said, still smiling warmly, &quot;Hiroki.&quot;
    It sounded so plain and friendly, the way a girl who ended up sitting
    next to her crush would call him, looking for some topic to bring up
    before homeroom began.&nbsp;&quot;You're probably a good person,
    Hiroki,&quot; she said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    didn't understand and knit his brows. His mouth might have been open.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    continued, lightly, as she were singing, &quot;Good people are good.
    In some respects. But even those good people can turn bad. Or maybe
    they end up being good their entire lives. Maybe you're one of those
    people.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    looked away from Hiroki and then shook her head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No,
    that's beside the point. I just decided to take instead of being
    taken. It's not a question of good or bad, wrong or right. It's just
    what I want to do.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki's
    lips trembled. They were twitching uncontrollably. &quot;Why though?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    smiled again. &quot;I don't know. But if I have to come up with some
    explanation. Well, for starters—&quot; She looked into Hiroki's
    eyes and then said, &quot;I was raped when I was nine years old.
    Three guys taking turns, three times each, oh, wait, one of them
    might have done it four times. One of you did it. Although they were
    middle-aged men. I was just a skinny kid back then, my chest was
    flat, and my legs were like sticks, but that's what they wanted. And
    when I started screaming that only excited them more. So even now
    when I'm with perverted men like that I still pretend to cry.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    stood frozen as he stared at Mitsuko who'd just revealed so much but
    continued wearing her pleasant smile. He was shocked by this
    devastating story.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    might have been on the verge of saying something. But before he
    could, a silver light flashed out of&nbsp;Mitsuko's hands. Hiroki
    realized Mitsuko had managed to reach behind her back with her right
    hand, but by then the double-bladed diver's knife (this used to be
    Megumi Eto's weapon) was already planted in his right shoulder.
    Hiroki let out a groan, and although he still held the gun, he
    staggered back in pain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    instantly got up, ran past Hiroki, and into the woods behind him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    quickly looked back and caught a glimpse of her as she vanished into
    the dark.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    knew if he didn't kill Mitsuko Souma now then Kayoko Kotohiki might
    be the next one to fall into her trap. But Hiroki couldn't bring
    himself to do it. Instead, he pressed his left hand against his right
    shoulder where the blood from the knife wound began to soak through
    his school coat. He stared into the dark where Mitsuko had
    disappeared.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course Mitsuko might have made up that story to stall him. But Hiroki
    couldn't buy that. Mitsuko told him the truth. And he'd only heard
    part of it. Hiroki had been puzzled over how a third-year junior high
    school girl his age could be so merciless. It turned out she had
    acquired the psyche of a grown adult a long time ago. A twisted
    adult's—no, maybe it was more accurate to say a twisted
    child's—psyche?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Slightly
    past 3:30 a.m., Toshinori Oda (Male Student No. 4) left the house he
    was hiding in. Immediately after he hid there, he surmised it was
    inside sector E-4. Sakamochi had announced the sector would be
    forbidden at 5 a.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    he opened the back door to leave, he glanced over at Hirono Shimizu's
    body, which he'd dragged into the corner. All he did was glance at
    the body lying face down. He didn't feel particularly sorry for her.
    After all this was a serious competition. You get what you deserve.
    Hirono Shimizu didn't even think twice about shooting him the moment
    she saw him. Of course, he'd been the one who snuck up behind Hirono
    to choke her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    he wasn't sure where his next resting spot should be, Toshinori
    finally decided to move east towards the residential area. The area
    on the map was approximately two hundred square meters. According to
    the map, the narrow flat land extending outward from the residential
    area turned into farm fields spotted with houses. Once he was well
    beyond this zone then all he had to do was hide in one of these
    houses. After all, he came from a privileged family and lived in what
    was probably the nicest house in the prefecture (Kazuo Kiriyama's
    house was probably the nicest, but Toshinori would never admit this).
    Hiding in bushes was beneath him. Entering a house was dangerous,
    given how someone might already be hiding there, but he wasn't
    worried. Now he not only had a bulletproof vest (with a certificate
    of high quality) but the revolver he'd taken from Hirono.
    Furthermore&nbsp;he was now wearing a full-face motorcycle helmet
    he'd found inside the house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    thin cloud appeared in the sky. Its tip was already slowly beginning
    to cross the low full moon. After checking the chin guard of his
    superdeluxe helmet, he crossed the yard and made his way down the
    edge of the narrow field next to it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    could see the flat land continuing down to the eastern shore. It
    wasn't completely flat, though. It went up and down. Most of the area
    was covered with farms visible by their various moonlit shades. On
    the&nbsp;left, a hundred meters away, was a house by the base of the
    northern mountain. There was another house another hundred meters to
    its right. Further left were two more houses. There were no other
    houses in the vicinity. Three to four hundred meters away were farms
    spotted with houses. He couldn't see very well because his view was
    blocked by a hill and the woods, but this geography seemed to
    continue out to the residential area on the island's east side. The
    flames from the intense explosion that came immediately after
    Sakamochi's midnight announcement were located immediately to the
    right of the hill. But the flames must have gone out, because now the
    area sank back into darkness.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    the south side, to his right, were two adjacent houses.&nbsp;But this
    was—if you assumed the blue dots indicated residential houses—on
    the borderline between sectors E-4 and F-4. Behind him the northern
    and southern mountains were connected—or to be more accurate, the
    base of the northern mountain stretched out like a cliff along the
    western shore without any houses in sight. According to the map
    though, there were supposed to be a couple houses up in the mountain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unless
    he'd misread the map, he'd be outside the forbidden zone if he got to
    the third or fourth house to the east. But if he found out they were
    dumps, then he might have to consider moving further on. First of
    all, he couldn't stand dirty houses, and second of all, he was
    certain a vulgar place would only attract vulgar people.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    decided to move over there.&nbsp;He crouched down and walked
    cautiously along the field ridge of the farm. But he was appalled at
    the sensation of dirty soil. The dull pain he felt from Hirono
    Shimizu's shot in the stomach area of his bulletproof vest only
    infuriated him more. Why did he have to be thrown into this coarse
    game and writhe around on the ground with the &quot;vulgar masses&quot;?
    (This was an expression his father, who ran the largest food company
    in the eastern part of the prefecture, often used at home, but it was
    a favorite phrase Toshinori himself used to express his scorn for the
    &quot;vulgar masses.&quot; Of course, he was well bred, so he could
    never say it out loud.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whether
    he had a right to claim it or not, it was true he possessed a unique
    gift, unique even among his talented classmates who ranged from being
    star players of their teams and clubs to being leading delinquents,
    or even being queer (this one was dead now—he was a very vulgar
    queer too). In fact, it was unique to the entire school.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    started private violin lessons when he was four years old, and now he
    was one of the leading junior high school players in the entire
    prefecture. He wasn't a genius, but he wasn't mediocre either.
    Arrangements were made for him to enter a highly distinguished high
    school in Tokyo that had its own music department. As for his future
    career, he thought he'd at the very least become the prefectural
    government symphony conductor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    gave him—so he believed—all the more reason not to die. He would
    attain the status of conductor, marry a beautiful, refined woman, and
    mingle with rich, elegant people. His older brother Tadanori was
    going to inherit the company. Of course, the thought of making a lot
    of money as president was attractive, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>but
    I don't need to deal with food products, yuck. I'll let my vulgar
    brother deal with that.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    He was different from his loser classmates. Their deaths wouldn't
    mean a thing, but he was gifted. He was precious. And even in
    biological terms, the superior species was destined to survive,
    right?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    first he only had this bulletproof vest, oddly supplied as a weapon,
    so all he could do was sneak away and hide, but now he had a gun. He
    was going to be merciless. What's this about the noble soul of a
    music lover? That's totally naïve! It was true he was only fifteen,
    and he hadn't seen much of the world,&nbsp;but he knew what the music
    world was like. For those who weren't geniuses it was all about money
    and connections. It was all about crushing other competitors to
    survive.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whether
    this was objectively true or not, this was what Toshinori Oda
    believed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course, he had no close friends in Third Year Class B that was filled
    with the vulgar masses. In fact, he despised his vulgar classmates.
    Especially Shuya Nanahara.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    did not take part in the Shiroiwa Junior High Music Club, which was
    filled with vulgar masses who were especially vulgar. All those
    losers played was popular music (apparently the club office was
    cluttered with music sheets of illegal foreign music). Especially
    Shuya Nanahara.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    was vastly superior to him in term of music ability, given his ear
    training and understanding of music theory. And yet, in spite of
    that, the vulgar bitches in his class would scream out indecently at
    the sound of Shuya Nanahara plucking out kindergarten-level chords on
    his guitar (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    mean come on. Those bitches who listen to Shuya Nanahara playing
    during the short break before music class, they might as well have
    printed on their foreheads in thick Gothic font: &quot;Oh, Shuya, do
    me now, right here&quot;</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">).
    In contrast, they'd only politely applaud when Toshinori finished
    playing an elegant passage from an opera at the music teacher's
    request.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    one thing, those loser bitches could never appreciate classical
    music, and for another, it was only because Shuya Nanahara was
    good-looking (although Toshinori would never admit it, deep down
    inside he couldn't stand his own ugly face).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Fine.
    That's what women are like anyway. They're just a different species.
    Just a tool to produce children (and of course to provide pleasure
    for men when they need it), and if they were good-looking then they
    were just ornaments to place beside successful men. Yes, it all came
    down to money and connections. And my talent is worth the investment
    of money and connections. Therefore...</i></font></font></p>

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    heard gunfire at times throughout the night, and there was that
    amazing explosion to top it all off, but now the island was immersed
    in darkness and silence. Toshinori quickly circled the first house,
    passed it, and approached the second one. He could tell it was pretty
    old even though he could only make out its silhouette. The house was
    surrounded by a circle of trees, and on the west side in front was an
    extremely large broadleaf tree, its branches spread out. Its
    circumference was four to five meters, and it was seven to eight
    meters tall.</font></font></p>

    show up. Just like cockroaches.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    spending a full five minutes passing by the side of the house, he
    looked over his shoulder and checked the house, which was surrounded
    by trees of various sizes. There were no suspicious movements that he
    could see through his open helmet's square window.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    turned around one more time.&nbsp;He thought something round and
    black stirred near the ground between the trees surrounding the
    house. It was&nbsp;someone's head, he realized, but by then he was
    aiming his gun over there. But this one was wandering in an area that
    would become a forbidden zone soon. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Who
    could it possibly be?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    didn't matter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    pulled the trigger. Holding the Smith &amp; Wesson Military &amp;
    Police's wooden grip, he felt a sudden jerk in the palm of his hand.
    The gun popped with an orange flash, sending a sting down Toshinori's
    spine. Although he despised the ignorant, vulgar masses, he had a
    hobby that wasn't so refined—much less refined than playing the
    violin. He still had his model gun collection. His father owned
    several hunting rifles, but he was never allowed to handle them, so
    this was the first time he'd ever pulled the trigger of a real gun.
    It was real.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    The person didn't shoot back either. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Of
    course not, if he had a gun he would have shot me from behind. That's
    what let me pull the trigger in the first place.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    slowly approached the figure. It shouted, &quot;Stop!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    could tell from his voice it was Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No.
    11). That tall guy (Toshinori, by the way, hated tall guys too. His
    height was only 162 centimeters and next to Yutaka Seto he was the
    shortest guy in their class. He couldn't stand: [a] good looking
    guys, [b] tall guys, and [c] all-around vulgar guys) who practiced
    that vulgar karate-like sport. He was supposedly going out with
    Takako Chigusa who tastelessly dyed her hair and wore all that gaudy
    jewelry—oh, yes, she was also dead now. She wasn't bad looking
    though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    continued, &quot;I'm not fighting this game! Who are you? Yuichiro?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    had guessed it was Yuichiro Takiguchi (Male Student No. 13), who was
    the next shortest guy to Toshinori. Yes, since Hiroshi Kuronaga had
    died a while ago, the only ones left alive who were his height were
    Yuichiro and Yutaka. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>In
    any case</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Toshinori wondered for a moment, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>what's
    this about not fighting? Impossible. Not playing this game would be
    tantamount to committing suicide. Is he trying to fool me? Even if he
    was, as long as he doesn't have a gun...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    changed his course of action. He lowered his gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    his left hand he pulled down on the chin guard of the helmet and
    said, &quot;It's Toshinori.&quot; Then he thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>oh,
    I should probably stutter a little</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    &quot;S-sorry I did that. A-are you hurt?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    Sugimura slowly got up, revealing his large frame.&nbsp;Like
    Toshinori he had his day pack on his right shoulder. His right hand
    held a stick. His right sleeve was missing, maybe it was torn or
    maybe he'd torn it off. His shirt was missing underneath and his
    right arm was bare. A white cloth was wrapped around the shoulder.
    With his bare right arm holding the stick he resembled a naked
    primitive tribesman. A vulgar naked tribe.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    all right.&quot; Then he asked, looking at Toshinori's head, &quot;Is
    that a helmet?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;U-uh
    yes.&quot; As he answered, Toshinori came forward, stepping onto the
    farm soil. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>All
    right, three more steps</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I-I've
    been so scaaaared.&quot; Before he finished saying &quot;scared&quot;
    Toshinori raised his right hand. Five meters&nbsp;away, he couldn't
    miss.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki's
    eyes opened wide. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Too
    late, too late, you vulgar karate bastard. You're going to die a
    vulgar death, end up in a vulgar grave, and I'll offer you the most
    vulgar flowers I can find.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Hiroki wasn't there at the end of the muzzle of the exploding Smith &amp;
    Wesson. A split second before the shot, Hiroki had unexpectedly
    ducked to his left—Toshinori's right. Toshinori of course had no
    idea Hiroki had used a martial arts move, but in any case, he was
    incredibly fast.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From
    this crouched position, Hiroki held up, instead of the stick in his
    left hand, a gun in his left hand (Toshinori also had no way of
    knowing that—although, in contrast to Shinji Mimura, he had &quot;fixed&quot;
    it—Hiroki was originally in fact left-handed). </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>So
    he already had a gun...then why didn't the fool use it in the first
    place?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Before this thought barely crossed his mind a small flame exploded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    gun was suddenly gone from his right hand. The next moment he felt a
    searing pain and his right ring finger exploded. Toshinori shrieked.
    He fell on both his knees and held the painful stump with his left
    hand—and realized his ring finger was gone. Blood spurted out. He
    might have been wearing a bulletproof vest and a helmet, but his
    fingers were unprotected.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Argh,

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    approached him, gun in hand. Toshinori held his right hand and gazed
    at it, his eyes inside his helmet terrified and delirious. His face
    was getting clammy from the sweat breaking out under his helmet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    said, &quot;So you're totally up for this. I don't want to shoot, but
    I have no choice. I have to.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    had no idea what Hiroki meant at all, and although he was in terrible
    pain, he still felt confident. The gun was pointed at his chest. Of
    course, it would be. He wore the helmet not so much because it was
    bulletproof but because it would force his enemy to aim at his body
    instead. And under his school coat he was wearing the bulletproof
    vest. As long as his vest stopped the bullet, then all he would have
    to do is wait for a chance to retrieve his gun and then—since his
    index finger was still working— he could pull the trigger and win.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    gun was by his feet.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    Toshinori glaring at him, Hiroki Sugimura still paused a few
    moments...but Hiroki pursed his lips tightly and calmly squeezed the
    trigger. Toshinori recalled his fight against Hirono Shimizu and
    considered how he should play &quot;dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    it ended much more than abruptly than he'd expected. Hiroki's gun
    only made a small metallic click.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    looked confused. He nervously cocked the gun and pulled the trigger.
    Again, click.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori's
    lips twisted into a smile hidden under the helmet. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Karate
    bastard. That was a dud. With that automatic you'll have to pull the
    breechblock and reload the chamber.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    went for his gun by his feet. Hiroki immediately responded with the
    stick in his right hand but instead—maybe he thought it was too
    far—he turned around and ran toward the mountain beyond the house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    picked up the gun. His crippled hand ached, but he still managed to
    hold it. He fired. Because his hold on the grip wasn't tight he
    couldn't fix his aim on Hiroki, but he could tell he hit him in the
    thigh, right near his butt. Did it only scrape him? In any case,
    Hiroki suddenly tottered, but he didn't fall. He&nbsp;continued
    tunning. Toshinori also started running and fired another shot. This
    time he missed. The recoil of the gun so pleasurable only moments ago
    now sent a sharp pain through his injured hand which infuriated
    Toshinori. He shot again. He missed again. In spite of being shot in
    the leg, Hiroki was faster than him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    disappeared into the woods at the foot of the mountain.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Damn
    it!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    deliberated whether he should chase him—and decided not to. His
    opponent was injured but so was he. The gun grip was slippery from
    the blood pouring from the stump of his former ring finger. Besides,
    if he entered the mountains now, Hiroki would reload his gun and
    shoot back. In that situation, it'd be too dangerous to expose
    himself like that with nothing to hide behind. He nervously crouched
    down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    had to get to the first house—the house he'd decided to enter. And
    he had to make sure Hiroki wouldn't see him enter it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    clutched his right hand, which was still holding the gun, and
    staggered over there, enduring the pain. As he traveled down the
    footpath the pain became more and more excruciating. He felt dizzy.
    First thing was his hand. He had to treat it. He had to come up with
    a different strategy. Oh, but, damn, even if he were able to play the
    violin after rehabilitation this crippled hand would stick out during
    a performance, especially if they televise it and zoom in. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>So
    now I'm going to be joining that lame group—the disabled. What a
    nice melody, how he's overcome his disability. How lame!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was approaching the house. Toshinori looked over his shoulder again.
    He looked closely, but didn't see any sign of Hiroki. He was safe
    now. Hiroki wasn't coming after him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    looked back at the house.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    saw a guy standing on the farm field six to seven meters away, right
    in front of the house he wanted. The guy had appeared suddenly out of
    nowhere. He had slicked-back hair that reached a little too far
    behind his neck and cold, gleaming eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    the time he realized it was Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No. 6)
    (another guy he couldn't stand—category [a] good looking), a heavy
    burst of fire came out of his hands along with a rattling sound,
    slamming against Toshinori's torso. Toshinori was blown back and fell
    backward. Because his grip on the gun had loosened from the pain he'd
    been feeling in his right hand, he dropped it and heard it knock
    against something. His back scraped against the dirt. His head
    wearing the helmet hit the ground.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    echoing gunfire faded into the night air. All was quiet once again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    of course Toshinori Oda wasn't dead. He held his breath and lay down,
    frozen, trying his best to restrain his urge to snicker. Now that he
    was overwhelmed by this wicked pleasure, the agonizing pain from his
    right hand, not to mention his anger at letting Hiroki Sugimura
    escape, or his anger at being suddenly attacked by a guy in category
    (a), his emotional faculties were a complete mess, but his body (with
    the exception of his right ring finger), just as it had been with
    Hirono Shimizu, was completely intact. So he was right to wear the
    helmet. Kazuo had aimed at Toshinori's torso, which was protected by
    the bulletproof vest. Just as Hiroki had done, Kazuo probably assumed
    Toshinori was dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    eyelids nearly shut, his field of vision resembled a widescreen
    movie. He could see at the far end of his field of vision the S&amp;W
    flash faintly against the moonlight. And now he could feel the stiff
    shape of the kitchen knife (which he found in the house where he'd
    killed Hirono Shimizu) he had tucked in back. It&nbsp;would take less
    than a second to unwrap the cloth around it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he continued to sweat, which was the one thing he couldn't hold back,
    Toshinori thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>all
    right, now pick up that gun lying over there. Then I'll slash that
    vulgar windpipe of yours. Or will you turn around and leave? Then
    I'll pick up the gun and dig a nice tunnel through that vulgar skull
    of yours. Come on. Make your choice. Just hurry up and choose.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    for some reason, instead of approaching the gun, Kazuo came straight
    at Toshinori.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was coming straight at him. Staring at him with those cold eyes.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Why?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Toshinori wondered. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    supposed to be dead. Look how good I am at playing dead.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    didn't stop. He kept on approaching. One step, two...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But
    I'm supposed to be dead! Why!?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    faint sound of his steps on the soil became louder and his field of
    vision was now filled with the figure of Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    overcome with panic and fear, Toshinori frantically opened his eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo's
    Ingram once again let out a burst of fire into Toshinori's shielded
    head. Some of the point-blank shots turned into colorful sparks from
    scraping against the reinforced plastic shell of the helmet while
    others, after exiting Toshinori's skull, ricocheted inside his
    helmet, rattling Toshinori's head along with the helmet. His body was
    dancing a strange boogie. Toshinori himself would have been irritated
    by this kind of vulgar dancing. And of course by the time it was all
    over...Toshinori's head was crushed inside his helmet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Toshinori
    no longer played dead. He remained frozen. Blood dripped out from
    under the helmet, which resembled a bowl of sauce.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    so this boy who despised the ignorant, vulgar masses, foolish
    Toshinori Oda, had overestimated the value of his bulletproof vest
    and underestimated Kazuo Kiriyama's calm actions. As a result he died
    easily. If he'd thought about how Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano had
    died yesterday morning, he would have realized that his assailant
    would have followed up on his enemy to deliver a coup de grace, but
    he wasn't so perceptive. Furthermore—it was quite irrelevant now—he
    had no idea his killer, Kazuo Kiriyama, had, in his mansion that was
    much larger than Toshinori's home in Shiroiwa-cho, mastered the
    violin at a level far superior to Toshinori's a long time ago (and
    then tossed his violin into the trash).</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some
    chatting. The sound of someone moving. She'd even settle for the
    faint sound of someone desperately trying to hold his or her breath.
    Instead, Mitsuko Souma (Female Student No. 11) ended up hearing the
    sound of liquid running through grass. She could tell it was someone
    pissing in the grove nearby (unless there was a dog on the island).
    Dawn was approaching. She glanced up and saw a faint blue beginning
    emerge in the dark sky.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    encountering Hiroki and somehow managing to escape him, Mitsuko first
    decided she needed a gun. She'd accidentally come across Megumi Eto
    and, upon hearing Yoshimi Yahagi and Yoji Kuramoto&nbsp;in the middle
    of their fight, she'd killed them and managed to get her hands on a
    gun (if she'd had a gun in the first place she would have gone back
    to the school and killed off everyone that came out one by one). Once
    she had a gun she could confidently move around the island, so it was
    easy to kill Takako Chigusa, who'd just finished fighting Kazushi
    Niida. (She should have finished her off though. She'd have to be
    more careful next time.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    now she was unarmed. She had used Megumi Eto's knife, and the only
    thing in her hand now was her original sickle from the beginning of
    the game. She had to get a gun because she wasn't the only one who
    chose to play this game. There was the machine gun shooter who killed
    Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano. She had just heard it go off again
    only thirty minutes ago.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course, thanks to the shooter, she didn't have to kill off as many of
    her classmates. She could just let the assailant take care of that.
    She'd only kill when it came easy. In fact, after midnight, when she
    heard the machine gun's rapid gunfire along with the explosion
    afterwards, she decided it was best to avoid that area. A handgun
    against a machine gun, she'd be outmatched. So she decided to move
    somewhere she could view the area from a distance, and that was how
    she ended up finding and following Hiroki Sugimura. And that was
    supposed to be an easy kill but...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was highly likely she'd end up having to take on this machine gun
    shooter. Not having a gun would be a major disadvantage. Forget about
    gun against machine gun, it'd be hopeless with a sickle against a
    machine gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course, she could have pursued Hiroki, but she thought it'd be too
    much trouble to get the gun back from him. His background in martial
    arts or whatever it was was no joke. Her right hand still stung from
    his blow. And this time, if he saw her, he'd be merciless and shoot
    her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    Mitsuko moved west along the longitudinal road and then entered the
    northern mountain, trying to find someone else. Approximately three
    hours had passed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    now she finally heard someone making noise.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    made her way through the thicket and moved forward, cautiously
    though.—She mustn't be heard.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    thicket ended. There was a small, open, mat-sized space in the middle
    of the bushes. The grove continued on and beyond her right. And to
    the left as well—in the corner of the space, a boy in his school
    coat had his back toward her. He nervously looked to his right and
    left as the dripping sound against the leaves continued.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was probably scared he might be attacked by someone. She could tell
    it was Tadakatsu Hatagami (Male Student No. 18). He was on the
    baseball team. Nothing exceptional, just an average guy. He was tall
    and well-built, and his face was average. His hobbies were...actually
    she had no idea, and besides there was no point asking now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    crucial thing was that, as Tadakatsu was attending to his business,
    Mitsuko realized he held something tightly in his right hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a gun. It was a fairly large model, a revolver. She once again
    broke into that fallen angel's grin.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    still wasn't done. He might have been holding it in for quite a
    while. He continued to look left and right while he emptied his
    bladder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    quietly but quickly took out her sickle with her right hand.
    Tadakatsu would have to use both of his hands to zip up his pants.
    Even if he tried using one hand, he'd be vulnerable.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>It
    looks like this'll be the end of you. Didn't someone in a detective
    show get killed this way?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    drips became sporadic. It stopped—and then another drip, and then
    it stopped completely. Tadakatsu once again looked around and then
    quickly moved his hands to the front.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    then Mitsuko had already snuck up behind him. The back of his head,
    with short spiked hair, was right in front of her. She raised the
    sickle.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    heard someone from behind say, &quot;Whoa,&quot; and Tadakatsu
    suddenly turned around, along with Mitsuko. She (of course) put the
    sickle down and looked back at the speaker behind her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was Yuichiro Takiguchi (Male Student No. 13). He was shorter than
    Tadakatsu and had a cute, boyish face. He held what appeared to be
    his weapon, an aluminum bat, in his right hand and stared at Mitsuko,
    his mouth agape.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    saw Mitsuko and also said, &quot;Whoa,&quot; and then muttered,
    &quot;Damn,&quot; and pointed the gun at her. Seeing how Yuichiro's
    appearance didn't surprise him, Mitsuko realized they were together.
    Mitsuko cursed herself. Tadakatsu had left Yuichiro just to take a
    piss. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    stupid could I have been not to check! Come on, you're both boys,
    can't you just pee next to each other?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    wasn't the time or place to lecture them. Tadakatsu's revolver
    (which, although it hardly mattered, was a Smith &amp; Wesson M19
    .357 Magnum) was pointed directly at Mitsuko's chest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Tadakatsu!
    Stop it!&quot; Yuichiro said, his voice trembling, probably from her
    sudden appearance and his fear of seeing someone get killed in front
    of his very own eyes. Tadakatsu looked like he was ready to pull the
    trigger at any moment, but his finger on the trigger stopped a
    fraction of a millimeter before the hammer fell.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    gun still pointed at Mitsuko, Tadakatsu looked over at Yuichiro.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why!?
    She just tried to kill me! Look! A sickle! She's holding a sickle!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;N-no.&quot;
    Mitsuko croaked as if her words were stuck in her throat. She made
    sure her voice was high-pitched and trembling, and of course, she
    didn't forget to flinch her body back. Once again, the star actress
    had a chance to show off her talents. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Watch
    me now.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I-I...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    thought of dropping the sickle, but decided not to, since it would
    look more natural holding it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    was just trying to call you. Then I-I realized you were peeing, so
    I...&quot; Mitsuko looked down and made her face blush. &quot;So...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    didn't lower the gun. &quot;You're lying! You were trying to kill
    me!&quot; His hand holding the gun was trembling. He'd restrained
    himself from shooting her because he'd never shot someone. The moment
    he saw her he probably would have fired reflexively, but now that
    Yuichiro had intervened he had time to think and hesitate. And that
    meant&nbsp;he would lose.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it, Tadakatsu,&quot; Yuichiro pleaded with him, &quot;Didn't I
    already say how we have to join up with others—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    got to be kidding.&quot; Tadakatsu shook his head. &quot;There's no
    way I can be with this bitch. Don't you&nbsp;know who we're dealing
    with? She might have been the one...who killed Yumiko and Yukiko.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;N-no...I
    would never...&quot; Mitsuko made her eyes brim with tears.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    said frantically, &quot;Mitsuko isn't carrying a machine gun. She
    doesn't even have a gun.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    can't know for sure! She might have tossed them once she ran out of
    bullets!!&quot;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    fell silent for a while, but then said, &quot;Tadakatsu, you
    shouldn't raise your voice.&quot; His voice sounded different from
    before. It was calm and kind. Tadakatsu opened his mouth slightly as
    if he'd been caught off guard.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    was also a bit surprised. Yuichiro Takiguchi was into anime. He was
    the otaku of their class, but now he sounded quite dignified.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    shook his head. &quot;You shouldn't be so indiscriminately
    suspicious,&quot; he continued as if admonishing Tadakatsu. &quot;Think
    about it. Mitsuko might have sought you out because she really
    trusted you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    then...&quot; Tadakatsu knit his brows. His gun was still pointed at
    Mitsuko, but the tension of his fingers on the trigger seemed to
    wane. &quot;Then what do you suggest we do?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;If
    you insist she can't be trusted, then we can take turns keeping an
    eye on her. I mean, even if we were to tell her to leave, you'd still
    be worried she might attack you later when she has the chance.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Well,

    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on. We need more people on our side. And then we have to figure out a
    way to get out of here. Once we spend some time with her we'll see
    whether we can trust her, right?&quot; Yuichiro insisted and finally
    Tadakatsu nodded, still eyeing her suspiciously.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    said in a tired voice, &quot;Well, all right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Making
    herself look relieved, she let her body unwind. She rubbed her left
    hand against her eyes deliberately filled with tears. Yuichiro let
    out a sigh of relief too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Get
    rid of that sickle,&quot; Tadakatsu said, and Mitsuko immediately
    tossed it to the ground. Then she nervously alternated glances at
    Tadakatsu and Yuichiro.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    said, &quot;Search her, Yuichiro.&quot; Mitsuko looked back at
    Tadakatsu, her eyes opened wide as if she didn't understand. Then she
    looked at Yuichiro who stood still in astonishment. Tadakatsu
    repeated himself. He aimed the gun at her. &quot;Hurry up. Don't be
    so bashful. This is a matter of life and death. You know that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay,
    all right.&quot; Yuichiro put his bat down and reluctantly came
    forward. He stood right beside Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hurry,&quot;
    Tadakatsu insisted.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His

    otaku self.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    said, &quot;U-uh, Mitsuko, I'm really sorry. I really don't want to
    do this, but I have to,&quot; and he ran his hands lightly over her
    body. Even in the dim light at dawn, she could tell his face had
    turned bright red. How cute. Of course, she didn't forget to act all
    embarrassed too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    he was done searching, he lifted his hands. Tadakatsu said, &quot;Look
    under her skirt too.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Tadakatsu—&quot;
    Yuichiro protested, but Tadakatsu shook his head.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    not trying to get my rocks off. I just don't want to die.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    Yuichiro blushed even more and said, &quot;U-uh, I was wondering,
    could you lift your skirt up a little?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Mitsuko only answered in a meek voice, &quot;O-okay,&quot; and lifted
    her skirt bashfully again up to where her underwear was nearly
    visible. Geez, this was turning into one of those adult videos titled

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    nodded and said, &quot;All right. Yuichiro, I want you to tie up her

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    gave Tadakatsu another reluctant look, but Tadakatsu refused to give
    in, aiming his gun at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Those
    are my conditions. If you can't accept them, then I'll shoot her
    now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    looked at Mitsuko, then at Tadakatsu, and licked his lips. Then
    Mitsuko said to Yuichiro, &quot;Yuichiro, go ahead. It's all right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    looked at Mitsuko, but then nodded, pulled out his belt, and held
    Mitsuko's hands. &quot;I'm sorry, Mitsuko,&quot; he said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    still pointed his gun at her, and said, &quot;You don't have to be so
    polite with her,&quot; but Yuichiro seemed to ignore his warning as
    he gently wrapped the belt around her wrists without saying another
    word.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she innocently offered her hands, Mitsuko was thinking how lucky, in
    spite of the situation, she was to have been discovered right before
    lifting her sickle. (She had also wiped the blood off the sickle
    earlier. Now that's luck.)</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    that's how I thought we had to seek other classmates,&quot; Yuichiro
    said and stopped, glancing at Mitsuko. Dawn had already broken, and
    she could see how his face was grimy with dirt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were sitting next to each other in the shrubs. Of course, Mitsuko's
    hands were tied up with the belt, and her sickle was tucked in the
    back of Yuichiro's pants. Tadakatsu Hatagami was in a deep sleep.
    He&nbsp;still held onto his gun which—he had in fact tied to his
    hand with a handkerchief.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    she ended up with this duo, Tadakatsu was the one who insisted on
    taking turns sleeping.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    agree we have to find others, but let's get some sleep. We've been up
    all this time. We'll lose our ability to make sound judgments.&quot;
    Once Yuichiro had agreed, Tadakatsu said, &quot;First, it's going to
    be Yuichiro or me. Then&nbsp;Mitsuko can sleep after us,&quot; and
    Yuichiro responded, &quot;I can sleep later,&quot; so the order was
    decided.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding
    his gun (it should have been handed over to Yuichiro who was keeping
    watch, but Tadakatsu didn't even mention it, nor did Yuichiro
    protest), Tadakatsu lay down and fell asleep within a matter of
    seconds.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    had an idea how they hooked up. Tadakatsu hadn't slept at all until
    he met Yuichiro, and he probably couldn't sleep after joining him.
    Why? Because he was probably afraid Yuichiro might attack him by
    surprise. And even though Mitsuko might be much more threatening than
    Yuichiro, now that she was with them, even if Tadakatsu slept,
    Mitsuko and Yuichiro would have to keep an eye on each other so long
    as he held onto his gun and remained cautious. He could still get
    some sleep. (Of course, Mitsuko hadn't slept at all either, but it
    was nothing to her. She was much tougher than your average wimpy
    junior high school kid.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    and Mitsuko remained silent for a while, but then Yuichiro told her
    how he'd ended up joining Tadakatsu.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    turned out that Yuichiro also didn't move at all during the day, but
    then assuming he was safer at night (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>of
    course</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Mitsuko thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>it
    could go either way. You could escape detection at night, but that
    also meant it was hard to detect your opponent too. But of course, if
    you were in a tight spot and had to run away, night was better</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">),
    he cautiously began to move and encountered Tadakatsu only two hours
    before Mitsuko encountered them. The two tried to concoct an escape
    plan but came up with nothing...and so Tadakatsu stepped out to pee,
    but because he was taking so long Yuichiro got worried and checked on
    him. And that was how he found Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    was so scared at first, I thought I couldn't trust anybody. But then
    I realized most of us probably just want to escape.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    stopped and glanced at Mitsuko. The otaku of Class B, Yuichiro
    Takiguchi avoided direct eye contact in his conversations. He always
    looked down. Still, from the way he talked to her, Yuichiro didn't
    seem to be all that cautious towards her. For some reason.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    so Mitsuko pretended to look somewhat relieved and asked him, &quot;So
    Tadakatsu had that gun.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    nodded. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Weren't
    you scared of Tadakatsu?&quot; </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Okay,
    now act even more relaxed and a little more intimate</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    &quot;No, I mean even now. He won't let go of it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    grinned. &quot;Well, first of all, Tadakatsu didn't shoot at me or
    anything. He did point his gun at me. I was classmates with him in
    elementary school. So I know him pretty well.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But...&quot;
    Mitsuko made her face look slightly pale. &quot;You saw how
    Yumi—Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano died. Some of us are playing
    this game. How can you be sure Tadakatsu isn't one of them?&quot; She
    nodded and then said, &quot;He even suspects me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    tightened his lips and nodded several times. &quot;That's true. But
    if we just sit still we'll end up dying. It's best to try. I can't be
    like Yumiko and Yukiko, but I was thinking how we could get others to
    join us&nbsp;gradually.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    glanced into Mitsuko's eyes for a moment and then looked down. He
    seemed even more withdrawn than usual, maybe because he wasn't used
    to looking at a girl's face so close up. (She was probably right on
    the mark, and on top of that, he was dealing with the most beautiful
    girl in the class.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    can't blame Tadakatsu for holding onto that gun. He's scared out of
    his wits.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    tilted her head and forced a smile. &quot;You're so good.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    glanced at her out of the corner of his eye.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    wearing her smile, Mitsuko continued, &quot;You have to be brave to
    be like that, to be able to empathize with others like that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    looked down bashfully again and nervously ran his right hand through
    his messy hair and said, &quot;I don't think so.&quot; Then without
    looking at her, he said, &quot;So...could you cut him some slack for
    suspecting you? I think he's really scared. He trusts no one.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Trust
    no one</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    The phrase really tickled her and she grinned.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she said as if sighing, &quot;I guess he can't help it. I have a
    reputation. You probably don't trust me either.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    paused and then turned to Mitsuko. This time he looked at her a
    little longer. Then he said, &quot;No.&quot; He looked down at the
    ground after saying this, and continued, &quot;Well, I mean, I'm even
    suspicious of Tadakatsu when it comes down to it. I mean...&quot; He
    pulled out some grass by his feet. Then he tore the grass that was
    moist with morning dew into small strands. &quot;I mean, yeah, I
    haven't heard great things about you. But that's so irrelevant in
    this situation. I mean, sometimes it's the respectable ones who end
    up breaking up under stress.&quot; He tossed the torn grass by his
    feet. Then he looked up at Mitsuko. &quot;I don't think you're such a
    bad person.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    tilted her head. &quot;Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    it was because she was staring at her, Yuichiro nervously looked away
    again. Then he said, &quot;Well...it's your eyes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Eyes?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    looking down, Yuichiro began tearing out more grass. &quot;You always
    had a scary look in your eyes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    forced a smile. She tried to shrug her shoulders, but it didn't work
    because of the belt around her wrists. &quot;I guess.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But...&quot;
    The grass was torn into quarters, then eighths. &quot;But sometimes
    your eyes look really sad and kind.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    stared at the side of his face and listened without responding.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So,&quot;
    he tossed the grass again and continued, &quot;I've always thought
    you weren't as bad as everyone said you were. Even if you'd done bad
    things, I was pretty sure you did them because you couldn't help it,
    because there was some reason behind it that wasn't your fault.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was stuttering, his voice incredibly shy and tense as if he were
    confessing his love to a girl. Then he added, &quot;I just don't want
    to be so foolish I couldn't understand that reason.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    sighed inside. Of course, she was thinking, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>boy,
    you are naïve, Yuichiro</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    But then she smiled and said warmly, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Even she
    was surprised by the kindness in her voice. Of course, it was
    deliberate, but maybe the reason it sounded too real to be an act was
    that there was a little bit of true feeling in her words.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    only a little.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    then asked, &quot;What about you, Mitsuko? What were you doing till
    now?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    replied, &quot;Well...&quot; She moved a little and felt the morning
    dew on the grass soaking through her skirt. &quot;I've been running
    away. You know, away from the gunfire. That's wh—that's why when I
    saw Tadakatsu I was so scared...but I was also so tired and scared of
    being alone and I thought of calling out to him. I thought maybe he'd
    understand...but I just couldn't tell whether it was the right thing
    to do or not. I just didn't know...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    nodded again. He glanced at her again and looked down. &quot;I think
    you did the right thing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    smiled and said, &quot;I think so too.&quot; Their eyes met and they
    smiled at each other.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right,&quot; Yuichiro said, &quot;I'm sorry. I forgot. You must be
    thirsty. You lost your bag, right? You probably haven't had any water
    in a while.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    had left her day pack behind when she fought Hiroki Sugimura. She was
    actually pretty thirsty. She nodded. &quot;Could I...could I have
    some water?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Looking
    away from her, Yuichiro nodded back, reached out for the day pack and
    picked it up. He pulled out two water bottles and after comparing
    them he chose the sealed bottle and tucked away the other one. He
    broke the seal off the new bottle.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    put up her belt-bound hands. Yuichiro was about to hand over the
    bottle to her...but then stopped. He glanced over at Tadakatsu who
    still seemed sound sleep, then looked down at the plastic bottle in
    his hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he put the bottle down by his leg.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hey
    there, aren't you going to let me have a drink? You decided not to
    spoil the prisoner because that might upset tough Sergeant Hatagami?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    took her hands without a word instead, had her raise them, and
    fingered the belt around her wrists. He began to unfasten it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yuichiro,&quot;
    Mitsuko said as if surprised (which in fact she was), &quot;Are you
    sure this is okay? Tadakatsu will be really mad.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Concentrating
    on her wrists, Yuichiro answered, &quot;It's all right. I have your
    weapon. Besides, how can you drink with your hands bound like that?&quot;
    Yuichiro glanced up at Mitsuko again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    smiled warmly and said, &quot;Thank you,&quot; making her cheeks
    blush as she looked down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    belt came loose. Mitsuko rubbed each of her wrists. Because the belt
    wasn't tight they were fine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    offered his bottle to Mitsuko. Mitsuko grabbed it and took two brief,
    delicate sips. She returned the bottle.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    all?&quot; he asked and stopped wrapping his belt around his waist.
    &quot;You can drink more. If we run out, we can always get more from
    some house with a well.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    shook her head. &quot;Oh no, I'm fine.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    took the bottle. After he stuffed it into his day pack, he buckled
    his belt around his waist.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    said to Yuichiro, &quot;Yuichiro.&quot; He looked up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    quickly reached out her free hands and gently held his right hand.
    Yuichiro appeared to tense up, not because he suspected her of some
    ulterior motive, but more simply because a girl was holding his hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;W-what?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    smiled warmly. She opened her nicely shaped lips and gently spoke,
    &quot;I'm so glad I'm with someone like you. I was so scared I've
    been shaking all this time...but now I'm safe.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    seemed to break into a grin. His tense mouth quivered and he finally
    managed to blurt out, &quot;You're safe.&quot; It seemed like he
    wanted to take his right hand back, but Mitsuko refused to let go,
    clutching onto it. Yuichiro had a hard time speaking and his voice
    sounded nervous, but then he managed to utter, &quot;I'll protect
    you, Mitsuko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    added, &quot;We have Tadakatsu too. He's pretty worked up right now,
    but once he calms down, he'll see you couldn't possibly be our enemy.
    Then the three of us can work on finding the rest of the class. Then
    we'll come up with some way of escaping.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    gave a warm smile. &quot;Thank you. I'm so relieved.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    squeezed her grip on Yuichiro's hand. Yuichiro blushed even more and
    glanced away again. He said, &quot;U-uh, Mitsuko. Y-you know, you're
    really p-pretty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    raised her brow. &quot;No. Really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    nodded repeatedly. Rather than nodding, he seemed to be trembling
    from the unbearable tension. This made Mitsuko smile and she realized
    this smile had no ulterior motive.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Well,

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi's
    6 a.m. announcement woke up Tadakatsu. He hadn't even slept two
    hours, but insisted it was enough and untied the handkerchief from
    his wrist to get a good grip on the gun. Then he sat by Mitsuko and
    Yuichiro. Yuichiro insisted on her sleeping before him, but Mitsuko
    abstained, so Yuichiro ended up lying down. (By this time, they had
    learned that four students—Keita Iijima, Toshinori Oda,</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yutaka
    Seto, and Shinji Mimura—had recently died. The new forbidden zones
    were not in their vicinity.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    was dismayed to find out the belt on Mitsuko's wrists had been
    unfastened, but Yuichiro managed to convince him it would be okay. Of
    course, even if Yuichiro hadn't unfastened the belt,</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    had plans to have it unfastened anyway...using Tadakatsu.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    then.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    couldn't really afford to take her time. If Hiroki Sugimura showed up
    he'd completely blow her cover. (She wondered, what is he doing
    wandering around like that anyway? Is he, like Yuichiro and
    Tadakatsu, trying to find others to hook up with?) And there was that
    machine gun shooter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    Yuichiro had said to Mitsuko with a smile, &quot;I might not be able
    to sleep,&quot; he went out like a light in five minutes. Given how
    he was an otaku boy, he couldn't have much stamina. He must be tired.
    Unlike Tadakatsu who snored, Yuichiro fell into the hushed deep sleep
    of a little baby.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    kept a good distance of three meters on her left, sitting against a
    tree. He had short, cropped hair and light acne above his cheekbones.
    And the eyes above them were cautiously watching Mitsuko. The
    revolver in his right hand was no longer pointed at her, but his
    finger was definitely on the trigger, as if to indicate he could
    shoot her at any moment.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    waited another half hour...and then after making sure Yuichiro, whose
    back faced them, was still asleep, she turned to Tadakatsu and
    quietly said, &quot;You don't have to look at me like that. I'm
    harmless.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    grimaced. &quot;You never know.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    if responding to Tadakatsu's retort, Yuichiro's body stirred a
    little. For a while Mitsuko and Tadakatsu looked at Yuichiro's back.
    His deep breathing resumed, though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    looking over at Tadakatsu, Mitsuko took a deep breath to indicate her
    fatigue. Then she moved her legs, putting her right knee down on the
    ground and bringing her left knee up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    pleated skirt smoothly slid down, revealing most of her white thighs,
    but Mitsuko just looked around, pretending not to notice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    could tell Tadakatsu had tensed up. Ha. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Maybe
    you can see my panties? They're hot pink silk</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    stayed in this position. Then she slowly looked over at Tadakatsu.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    nervously looked up. Of course, until then his eyes had been glued to
    her thighs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Mitsuko still acted as if she were clueless and said, &quot;Hey,
    Tadakatsu.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    seemed to be doing his best to maintain his intimidating stance, but
    now there was a slight tremble in his voice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    am so scared.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    thought Tadakatsu would say something nasty again, but he didn't
    respond and only stared at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Aren't
    you scared?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu's
    brow moved a little, but then he said, &quot;Of course, I am. That's
    why I'm being so careful with you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    looked sadly away from Tadakatsu. &quot;So you still won't trust me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    hold it against me,&quot; Tadakatsu said, but his tone of voice
    wasn't even half as hostile as it had been. &quot;I know I'm
    repeating myself, but I just don't want to die.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    quickly looked back at Tadakatsu. She said a little emphatically,
    &quot;I'm in the same boat too. I don't want to die. But if you don't
    trust me, then we'll never be able to cooperate and find a way to
    save ourselves.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh,
    well—&quot; Tadakatsu nodded as if relenting. &quot;Well...I know
    that but...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    smiled warmly. She looked into her opponent's eyes and her
    well-formed, red lips smiled___It was different from the one she wore
    during her somewhat idyllic conversation with Yuichiro. This one was
    Mitsuko Souma's special fallen angel's smile. Tadakatsu's eyes were
    glazed, seduced.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    Tadakatsu,&quot; she continued as she returned to her terrified-girl
    face. This constant switch between expressions, the virgin and the
    whore, day and night. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Wow.
    Sounds like a movie title.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;W-what?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know I keep on saying this, but I'm just so scared.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;U-uh
    huh.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So?&quot;
    She looked at him directly again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So?&quot;&nbsp;Any
    trace of antagonism and suspicion was now gone from Tadakatsu's voice
    and face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    tilted her head slightly and asked, &quot;Can we talk a little?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Talk?&quot;
    He knit his brows. &quot;Aren't we doing that right now?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    hissed, &quot;Don't be stupid. Do I have to spell it out?&quot; Her
    eyes glued on Tadakatsu, she pointed her chin at Yuichiro. &quot;Not
    here, okay? I want to talk to you, but not with Yuichiro here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    mouth slightly open, Tadakatsu gazed over at Yuichiro and then looked
    back at Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay?&quot;
    Mitsuko said. She got up, looked around, and decided the thicket
    behind Tadakatsu would be best. She walked over to Tadakatsu, tilted
    her head slightly, and then proceeded forward. She wasn't sure
    whether he would take the bait...but then after a while she could
    tell he was nibbling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    stopped approximately twenty meters away from where Yuichiro slept.
    Just like the previous area, it was a small opening surrounded by
    bushes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    she turned around, Tadakatsu appeared, wading through the thicket.
    His eyes were glazed. But maybe it was subconscious. He still kept a
    tight grip on his gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    immediately pulled down the side zipper of her skirt. Her pleated
    skirt fell to the ground, exposing her thighs in the dull morning
    light. She could tell he was holding his breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she removed her scarf and undressed. Unlike the other girls she'd
    never be so square as to wear an undershirt, so she only had her
    underwear on now. Oh right, she had to take off her shoes. After she
    took them off, she stared at Tadakatsu with her fallen angel's smile.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;M-Mitsuko,&quot;
    Tadakatsu barely managed to utter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    decided to make sure. &quot;I'm so scared, Tadakatsu. So...&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    awkwardly approached Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    looked down at his right hand, pretending to suddenly notice the gun,
    and said, &quot;Put that thing somewhere else.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    lifted his hand, as if he suddenly became aware of its existence, and
    gazed at it. Then he put it down, away from them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    approached her again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    gave a nice smile, spread out her arms, and wrapped her hands around
    his neck. His body trembled but the moment Mitsuko offered her lips,
    he immediately began sucking on them. Mitsuko received him by
    breathing heavily.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    a while their lips separated.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    looked up at Tadakatsu's eyes and said, &quot;This is your first
    time, huh?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    what?&quot; Tadakatsu said, his voice trembling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    fell down on the grass, Mitsuko underneath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    immediately went for her breasts.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>You
    idiot, you're supposed to make out for a while before you do that</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Mitsuko thought. Instead she moaned, &quot;Ahh...&quot; Tadakatsu's
    rough hands slipped off her bra and clutched at her well-endowed
    breasts, now exposed. Then his face went down there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ahh...ahh...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    continued pretending to be turned on (in exaggerated porn-video
    style), but meanwhile her right hand was reaching down to her
    panties.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    fingertips touched a hard, thin object.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gang
    girls probably didn't use such cheap, clunky weapons anymore. But
    it'd been Mitsuko's weapon of choice for a long time now. The most
    useful weapon right now for her was in fact something she could hide
    in her panties.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    was preoccupied with kissing Mitsuko's breasts. His left hand reached
    between her legs. Mitsuko then let out a moan...but Tadakatsu's eyes
    were concentrating on her breasts. His scalp was exposed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    slowly moved her right hand near his neck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Sorry,
    Tadakatsu. But at least you get to go out with a nice memory, so you
    can forgive me, right? Too bad we won't go all the way, though.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko's
    right ring finger gently touched Tadakatsu's neck. The object was
    between her index and middle finger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kaw
    kaw, a bird cried, unfortunately, to her right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    raised his head reflexively and glanced over in that direction.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was only the sound of a bird crying. What really made Tadakatsu's
    eyes open wide was of course&nbsp;the razor blade in Mitsuko's hand
    right in front of his face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Damn
    it!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    bad can my timing be?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    The thought sort of crossed her mind, but Mitsuko didn't care as she
    automatically swung the blade.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    groaned and pulled away from Mitsuko. The blade skimmed his neck, but
    the cut was way too shallow to be fatal. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>My
    oh my, good reflexes. That's right, you're a baseball jock.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    stood up, his eyes open wide, staring down at Mitsuko, her body half
    raised. He appeared to be on the verge of saying something but seemed
    at a loss for words.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    could care less about Tadakatsu's state. She leaped up and made a
    dash for the revolver immediately to her right.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Tadakatsu's body flew in front of her in a head-first slide. He
    scooped the gun from the ground, rolled over, and got up on his
    knees. Ever since elementary school Tadakatsu played the shortstop
    position formerly occupied by Shuya Nanahara (even though she and
    Shuya went to different schools Shuya's reputation as a star player
    in Little League was so widespread even Mitsuko had heard of him), so
    his reflexes served him well. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
    Shiroiwa Junior High School baseball team is in good hands, huh?
    Well, at least you didn't take off your pants. You would have looked
    pretty pathetic naked.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    Mitsuko realized Tadakatsu would get the gun before she did, she
    changed course. She heard gunshots behind her, but they missed as she
    ran into the thicket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    could hear Tadakatsu chasing her. He would catch up. That was for
    sure.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    got out of the thicket. There was Yuichiro Takiguchi. He looked like
    he'd heard the gunfire, got up, and then realizing Mitsuko and
    Tadakatsu were gone, was looking around, but the moment his eyes
    found her, they opened wide. (Of course. She was half naked. What a
    bonus! Mitsuko Souma's One Night Show. Oh wait, but it's morning.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yuichiro!&quot;
    Mitsuko raised her voice and ran towards Yuichiro. She didn't forget
    to crumple up her face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;W-what
    happened, Mitsuko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    the time Tadakatsu Hatagami made his way through the bushes, Mitsuko
    was behind Yuichiro's back. Because Yuichiro was only four or five
    centimeters taller than her, she couldn't really hide behind him, but
    oh well.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yuichiro!&quot;
    Tadakatsu stopped and held his gun, groaning. &quot;Get out of my
    way!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;H-hold
    on.&quot; His face still drowsy, Yuichiro spoke quickly perhaps
    because he didn't fully grasp the situation. Mitsuko grabbed his
    shoulders from behind and pressed her half naked body against his
    back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    said, &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Mitsuko
    tried to kill me! I told you, man!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    hiding behind Yuichiro, Mitsuko said in a feeble voice, &quot;Th-that's
    not true. Tadakatsu tried to force&nbsp;me to—he threatened me with
    that gun. Please, help me, Yuichiro!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu's
    face contorted in dismay. &quot;I-it's not true, Yuichiro! Th-that's
    right. Look!&quot; Tadakatsu pointed at his neck with the fingers of
    his empty left hand. The narrow cut had a slight blood stain. &quot;She
    went at me with a razor blade!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    turned around and looked at Mitsuko out of the corner of his eye.
    Mitsuko shook her head as cutely as possible, as if terrified. Now
    she was playing the virgin again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    was so desperate, I had to use my nails on him. Then...Tadakatsu got
    mad. He tried to shoot me...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    had already gotten rid of the razor blade in the shrubs. Even if she
    were forced to take off all her clothes (she was nearly naked anyway
    now) for a body search, they'd find no evidence.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    Tadakatsu's face flushed red with anger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Move,
    Yuichiro!&quot; he shouted. &quot;I'm shooting her!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on,&quot; Yuichiro said, trying his best to sound calm, &quot;I-I
    can't tell who's telling the truth.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What!?&quot;
    Tadakatsu raised his voice, but Yuichiro wasn't intimidated. He
    reached out his right hand to Tadakatsu.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Give
    me your gun. Then we'll see who's telling the truth.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu's
    face contorted as if he were on the verge of crying out of misery.
    And wearing this face he screamed at Yuichiro, &quot;We can't afford
    to take our time here! You're going to get killed too if we don't get
    rid of her now!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    cried out, &quot;That's awful. I would never do that. Help me,
    Yuichiro.&quot; She squeezed his shoulders tightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    patiently extended his hand. &quot;Give it to me, Tadakatsu if you're
    telling the truth.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    grimaced again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    eventually, after taking a long, deep breath, letting his shoulders
    down, he exhaled and lowered his gun. He put his finger on the
    trigger guard, flipped the gun grip forward, and offered it to
    Yuichiro as if he had no choice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course she still wore her weepy face... but there was a faint glimmer
    in her eyes. The key moment would be when the gun was in Yuichiro's
    hands. It should be easy to take away from him. The question was how.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    nodded and came forward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a move that was almost identical to the one Hiroki Sugimura had
    made with the Colt Government against her. Like a magic trick, the
    gun flipped over in his hand. Simultaneously, Tadakatsu got down on
    his right knee and leaned sideways. The gun was pointed directly at
    Mitsuko, its line of fire passing right by Yuichiro's left shoulder.
    Now that she wasn't clinging to Yuichiro's back Mitsuko was
    completely exposed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    followed the gun's target and quickly looked back at Mitsuko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko's
    eyes opened wide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    dead now—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    hesitating, Tadakatsu pulled the trigger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gunfire.
    Two shots.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro's
    body fell down slowly as if in slow motion right in front of her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Beyond
    it was the frightened face of Tadakatsu.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    then Mitsuko had picked up the sickle Yuichiro had beside him when he
    went to sleep.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    threw it. It spun through the air. Its banana-shaped blade lodged
    into Tadakatsu's right shoulder. He groaned and dropped his gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    didn't waste a single moment. She picked up the bat and dashed
    forward. She leapt over Yuichiro, who was lying face down, ran
    towards Tadakatsu, and with this forward momentum took a full swing
    at his head as he staggered, clutching his right shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hey
    there. Here's something familiar, a bat. Hope you like it.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thud.
    The end of the bat landed in the center of his face. She'd crushed in
    his nose cartilage and cheekbones, tearing out several of his teeth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    fainted. Mitsuko swung at his forehead. KRAK! His forehead caved in.
    His eyes bulged out and his hands balled up into fists. One more
    swing, this time she aimed at the bridge of his nose. Mitsuko Souma's
    Special Training for One Thousand Catches. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Come
    on, come on, this next one's going into center field.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Blood
    burst out of Tadakatsu's nostrils with this blow.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    put the bat down. Tadakatsu's entire face was immersed in blood. He
    was dead by now. Thick streams of blood came dripping out of his ears
    and his deformed nose.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    tossed the bat and picked up the pistol lying to her left.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she walked over to Yuichiro who was lying down on his face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    bloodstain spread all over the grass underneath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    had shielded Mitsuko. That one instant.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    slowly knelt down by Yuichiro. She could tell he was still breathing
    as she bent over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    some consideration, Mitsuko moved over to block Yuichiro's view of
    Tadakatsu's corpse. Then she grabbed his shoulder to turn him over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    moaned, &quot;Urgh,&quot; and opened his eyes in a daze. His school
    coat had two holes, one in the left chest and the other in his side.
    Blood came pouring out, absorbed by the black fabric. Mitsuko held
    Yuichiro up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    eyes wandered around for a while. Then he looked at Mitsuko. His
    short breaths came intermittently,&nbsp;matching his heartbeat.
    &quot;M-Mitsuko...&quot; he said, &quot;wh-what about Tadakatsu?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    shook her head. &quot;He panicked after he shot you and just ran
    away.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tadakatsu
    had tried to kill Mitsuko so this explanation didn't make much sense.
    But maybe he couldn't think much anymore. Yuichiro seemed to nod
    slightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;R-really...&quot;
    His eyes seemed out of focus. He might only have a partial image of
    Mitsuko now. &quot;Y-you didn't get hurt, I hope?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    fine.&quot; She nodded. And then said, &quot;You saved me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuichiro
    seemed to form a slight grin. &quot;I-I'm so sorry. I-I don't think I
    can protect you anymore. I-I can't m-m-move...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Foams
    of blood came bursting out the sides of his mouth. His lungs must
    have been punctured.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know.&quot; She leaned over and gently hugged his body.&nbsp;Mitsuko's
    long black hair fell onto his chest, its ends stained by the blood
    pouring out of his wounds. Before she pressed her lips against his,
    Yuichiro's eyes moved slightly but then they shut.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    kiss was different from the whore's kiss she gave to Tadakatsu
    moments ago. It was soft, warm, and kind even though it might have
    been mixed with the taste of blood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Their
    lips parted. Yuichiro opened his eyes again in a semi-daze.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I-I'm
    sorry...&quot; he said, &quot;it looks like...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    smiled. &quot;I know.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	BLAM!
    BLAM! BLAM! With these dull gunshots Yuichiro's eyes opened wide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Staring
    up at Mitsuko's face, and probably having no idea what had just
    happened, Yuichiro Takiguchi was now dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mitsuko
    slowly removed the smoking revolver from Yuichiro's stomach and held
    Yuichiro's body again. She looked into his now vacant eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    were pretty cool. You even made me a little happy. I won't forget
    you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    closed her eyes. Almost remorsefully, she once again gently pressed
    her lips against Yuichiro's. His lips were still warm.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    sunlight was finally shining on the western slope of the northern
    mountain. Under Mitsuko's head, blocking this light, Yuichiro's

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    Nanahara (Male Student No. 15) suddenly woke up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    saw the blue sky framed by brilliant green grass.&nbsp;He got up.
    Beyond the grass surrounding him, there was the familiar sight of
    Shiroiwa Junior High School&nbsp;in the pleasant sunlight.&nbsp;Several
    students were on the school field in their gym gear. Maybe they were
    playing Softball for gym class. He could hear their cheering.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was in the garden at the edge of the courtyard. He saw the large
    leaves of the phoenix tree looming above him. This was where he took
    a nap sometimes, either during lunch or when he cut class.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    stood up and checked his body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    had no wounds at all. Flakes of grass were stuck to his coat. He
    brushed them off.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    dream...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head, still in a daze. Then he knew for certain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was all a dream. All of it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    wiped his neck with his hand. It was moist with sweat. He was
    drenched in sweat as if he'd had a nightmare.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What
    a horrible dream! Killing game? We were selected for that &quot;Program&quot;!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he realized. The ones in the field? Gym class?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    checked his watch. Afternoon classes had started. He'd overslept!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    quickly left the garden and trotted over to the school building.
    Today. Today was...he checked his watch while running and saw it was
    Thursday.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    first Thursday afternoon period was literature. He felt relieved. He
    liked literature, and he did pretty well in that class. Plus his
    teacher, Kazuko Okazaki, liked him. So all he'd have to do is bow
    apologetically.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Literature.
    Favorite subject. Grades. Ms. Okazaki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These
    words passing through his mind triggered a nostalgic feeling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    really did like literature. Even if the stories and essays in the
    textbooks were inundated with slogans in praise of the Republic or
    some silly &quot;ideology,&quot; Shuya managed to discover words he
    liked. Words were just as important to him as music. Because rock
    couldn't do without lyrics.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Speaking
    of words, the top student in literature, Noriko Nakagawa, wrote
    beautiful poetry. Compared to the song lyrics he struggled to come up
    with, her words were so much more concise and brilliant...they could
    be open and gentle on the one hand and harsh and strong on the other.
    He thought they represented the nature of girls in general. Sure,
    Yoshitoki Kuninobu had a crush on Noriko, but what really struck
    Shuya was this part of her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Which
    made Shuya realize, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>oh,
    that means Yoshitoki is alive</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    Realizing how silly the whole ordeal was, he was about to cry from
    relief as he trotted over. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    silly. I can't believe I could dream of Yoshitoki dying.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>And
    how did I end up with Noriko? Hey wait, since when did I stop calling
    her &quot;Noriko-san&quot;? How presumptuous I was in that stupid
    dream,&nbsp;</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">he
    thought. They were linked together in the dream. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>So
    does that mean I have some feelings for her beyond admiring her
    poetry? Uh oh, that means I'll end up fighting with&nbsp;Yoshitoki.
    That's trouble.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still,
    this idle thought made him grin.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    entered the school building, now hushed because classes were in
    session. He ran up the stairs. Third Year Class B was on the third
    floor. He skipped every other step.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    reached the third floor and turned right into the hall. The second
    classroom was Class B.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stopped by the door for a moment, trying to come up with an excuse
    for Ms. Okazaki. He was feeling sick—no, he had a dizzy spell. So
    he had to lie down and rest. Would she believe him, given how he was
    always in perfect health? Yoshitoki would give an exaggerated shrug,
    and someone like Yutaka Seto would say something like, &quot;I bet
    you were sleeping,&quot; Shinji Mimura would snicker, and Hiroki
    Sugimura, his arms folded, would look mildly amused. Noriko would
    smile at Shuya as he scratched his head. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>All
    right, that's what I'll go with. So what if it's embarrassing?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    put his hand on the door, made himself look as apologetic as
    possible, and gently slid it open.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    before he looked up from the formal posture he assumed, a stench
    assaulted him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked up. He slid the door open with all his might.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    first thing he saw was someone lying by the lectern.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ms.
    Okazaki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    wasn't Ms. Okazaki. It was their head instructor, Masao Hayashida.
    And his head was missing. There was a puddle where it was supposed to
    be. Only half of his eyeglass frames were lying beside him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    tore his eyes off of Mr. Hayashida's corpse and examined the rest of
    the class.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    were desks and chairs lined up as usual.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    strange thing was that his familiar classmates were all sprawled over
    their desks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    floor was covered with blood. An intense stench wafted up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    standing still for a moment, he quickly reached out for Mayumi
    Tendo...and realized that an antenna-like silver arrow was planted in
    her back. Its tip was poking out of her stomach while blood dripped
    down and off her skirt onto the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    moved forward. He shook Kazushi Niida's body. Kazushi's body tilted
    with a jerk, revealing its face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    felt a chill run up his spine. Kazushi's eyes were now two dark-red
    holes. Blood and a slimy egg-white-like substance oozed out of them.
    Then there was a gimlet-like object with a thick handle stabbed into
    his mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    screamed and ran to Yoshitoki Kuninobu's seat. There were three holes
    in his back, each one blooming with flowers of blood. As he held him
    up, Yoshitoki's head slumped over onto his shoulder. His bulging eyes
    gazed up at the ceiling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yoshitoki!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    raised his voice. Then he looked around frantically.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everyone
    was either slouched back in their chairs or lying on the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Megumi
    Eto's throat was slashed like sliced watermelon. A sickle was planted
    in Yoji Kuramoto's head. Sakura Ogawa's head was split open like an
    overripe fruit. Only half of Yoshimi Yahagi's head existed. An axe
    was planted in Tatsumichi Oki's head, his face cracked down the
    middle, left and right out of alignment like a split peanut. Kyoichi
    Motobuchi's stomach looked like a sausage-factory trash bin.
    Tadakatsu Hatagami's face was completely crushed and covered in
    blood. Hirono Shimizu's face was swollen black, and her
    sea-slug-sized tongue dangled out from the side of her wide open
    mouth. The body of The Third Man, Shinji Mimura, was covered with
    bullets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Basically,
    everyone was dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    caught Shuya's eye. Shogo Kawada—that standoffish transfer student
    with the bad reputation—had deep stab wounds all over his chest.
    His eyes were half-open and looking down at the floor. They were out
    of focus.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath and looked over at Noriko Nakagawa's seat. It was
    right behind Yoshitoki's, so he could have noticed earlier. For some
    reason though, it felt as if his classmates' seats were swirling
    around with the corpses. He finally managed to locate Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was still sprawled on top of her desk.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    ran to her and held her up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	THUD.
    Her head fell off. Leaving behind her body, it landed with a thud on
    the floor and rolled around in a pool of blood, and then looked up at
    Shuya. With eyes full of resentment. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    thought you said you would save me, Shuya. But I ended up dying. I
    really loved you, too. I really did.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    eyes glued to Noriko's face, Shuya held his head and opened his
    mouth. He felt he was going crazy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    could tell a scream was welling up inside.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    he saw something white.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he became physically aware that his body was in fact horizontal, his
    vision came into focus, and Shuya finally realized it was the
    ceiling. On the left side he saw a fluorescent light.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Someone
    gently touched his chest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    realized how heavy he was breathing. His eyes followed the hand up to
    the arm, the arm up to the shoulder, and finally discerned a
    sailor-suit figure with braided hair—female class representative
    Yukie Utsumi (Female Student No. 2), smiling warmly.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    gently touched Shuya's chest again, then lifted the puffy blanket up

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wasn't able to respond coherently. Instead he surveyed the room. It
    was small. There was cheap fabric wallpaper on the left wall, and on
    the right behind Yukie was another bed, but besides that there wasn't
    much else. There was a door near the foot of the bed, but it was
    closed. The wooden frame gave it an old look. There seemed to be a
    window above his head letting in a dull light which illuminated the
    room. Given how dull the light was it seemed cloudy outside. But
    where was he?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't get it,&quot; Shuya said. He realized he could speak now. &quot;I

    representative.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was still in a half daze, but Yukie gave a sigh of relief. Then her
    full lips erupted into a soft chuckle. &quot;You would say that,
    wouldn't you? I'm so relieved you're all right though.&quot; Looking
    at Shuya, she added, &quot;You were out for quite some time. Let

    Nakagawa,&quot; Yukie mentioned the cheery girl who had the same last
    name as Noriko. Then she continued, &quot;Satomi Noda and Chisato
    Matsui. Haruka Tanizawa. And Yuko Sakaki.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    licked his lips. Yukie saw the expression on his face and asked,
    &quot;What? You can't trust them? Which one? Everyone?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No...&quot;
    Shuya shook his head. &quot;If they're your friends I trust them.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    how did six girls, all good friends with each other, manage to get
    together?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    smiled and squeezed his hand. &quot;Good. I'm glad to hear that from
    you, Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    smiled too. But his smile receded almost instantly. There were other
    things he had to know. He'd already missed three—the midnight, 6
    a.m., and noon announcements.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Who...died?&quot;
    he asked. &quot;I-I mean, at midnight, 6 a.m., and noon, there were
    three announcements, right? Did anyone else die?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie's
    mouth stiffened. She took some paper from the small side table right
    beside them. It was a map and student list. The folds and mud stains
    looked familiar. He realized it was the one he'd kept in his school
    coat pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    looked over the list and said, &quot;Hirono Shimizu. And then Keita
    Iijima, Toshinori Oda, Yutaka Seto, Yuichiro Takiguchi, Tadakatsu
    Hatagami, and Shinji Mimura.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    mouth hung open. Of course the game had proceeded, but he was shocked
    it now left only little more than a dozen students. Plus he'd been
    teammates with Tadakatsu Hatagami in Little League, but what really
    took him by surprise was...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shinji's...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    Third Man, Shinji Mimura, had died. It was hard to believe. He
    thought if anyone could survive it would have been Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    nodded silently.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    the same time Shuya was struck by how he wasn't all that shaken up.
    He'd gotten used to it. That must have been it. Still, he remembered
    Shinji's special grin. Then he recalled that serious expression
    Shinji wore as he sent him a signal, warning him to calm down when
    they were back in the school building.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>So
    we're never going to see the awesome play of The Third Man, Shiroiwa
    Junior High's star shooting guard, again</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    he thought, and felt a pang of sorrow.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;When
    was Shinji's name announced?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;In
    the morning,&quot; Yukie answered. &quot;Keita Iijima and Yutaka Seto
    were also in the morning. They might have been together. They were
    such good friends.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shinji
    had still been alive at midnight. And as Yukie said, he might have
    been with Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    added, &quot;There was an incredible explosion last night. And a lot
    of gunfire. That's where it might have come from.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Explosion?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    recalled the hand grenade Kazuo threw at them. &quot;That was—Kazuo
    actually used a hand grenade. Maybe that's what you heard.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    raised her brow. &quot;So that's what that was. That was a little
    past eleven, right? No, the one I'm talking about actually happened
    after we brought you here. It was past midnight. It was much worse
    than the one we heard around eleven. The one who kept watch said the
    entire center of the island just lit up.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pursed his lips, but then he realized he still hadn't managed to find
    out exactly where they were.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    he could ask though, Yukie handed him the map and student list. &quot;This
    is yours. I marked off the map too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he took it, Shuya realized, yes, there were more forbidden zones. He
    spread the map out. &quot;The place where we talked about rock.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    place, sector C-3, near the western shore, was crossed out with a
    pencil along with several other sectors. The small writing, &quot;23rd,
    11 a.m.&quot; meant that it was forbidden as of this morning at
    eleven, while Shuya had been asleep.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pursed his lips. Noriko and Shogo weren't there anymore—his
    thoughts were finally getting clearer—if they haven't died between
    noon and now. Of course they were alive. But then he recalled how
    he'd seen Shogo and Noriko dead along with Yoshitoki and Shinji in
    his dream. He felt a chill run down his spine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    in any case they should be alive. All he could do was believe they
    were all right. But how in the world would he find them?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    put the map down on his chest. He couldn't afford to waste any time
    deliberating, under these circumstances. The first thing was
    information.&nbsp;And since he wasn't alone there might be a way.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked up at Yukie. &quot;Where are we anyway? How did I end up in
    this bed?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    looked up at the window and said, &quot;This is a lighthouse.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Lighthouse?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,
    on the northeast end of the island. It's marked on the map. We've
    been staying here ever since the game started.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at his map again. Just as Yukie said, the lighthouse was
    located in sector C-10, jutting out from the northeast side of the
    island. The area was practically devoid of forbidden zones.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    Shuya, about last night. The front of this lighthouse is a cliff, and
    that's where you fell. The person keeping watch found you...and took
    you in. You were injured pretty badly. Covered with blood. I thought
    you were going to die.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    finally realized his torso was naked and that his throbbing left
    shoulder was bandaged. (Given how it felt, he deduced the bullet
    shattered his shoulder blade and was now lodged in there.) The right
    side of his neck—he felt a burning sensation right below his collar
    where there was another bandage (but this bullet wound must have been
    a minor scrape). And then on top of his left elbow. (It felt heavy.
    The bullet had most likely exited, but perhaps because the bone or
    tendon was torn off, it felt paralyzed.) Also his left side. (The
    bullet had pierced it, but it seemed to have missed his vital
    organs.) Shuya awkwardly moved his unscathed right arm and lifted his
    blanket, confirming he was indeed covered with bandages.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    returned the blanket and asked, &quot;So you treated me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,&quot;
    Yukie nodded. &quot;We found an emergency first-aid kit in the
    lighthouse. We stitched your wounds a little. Not a great job, since
    we didn't know what we were doing and we could only use the string
    and needle from a sewing set. It looks like the bullet in your
    shoulder...is lodged in there. We couldn't do much. I thought what
    you really needed was a blood transfusion. You were bleeding so
    badly.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Thanks
    a lot.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh
    no,&quot; Yukie smiled kindly. &quot;I can't believe I got to touch a
    guy's body! I even got to take off your clothes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    chuckled. While she was both very smart and considerate, she could
    also say bold stuff like that. She'd been like that ever since he got
    to know her on a rainy day in the elementary school gym, negotiating
    the space allocated for Little League practice and girls' volleyball.
    At the time he'd said to Yoshitoki, &quot;Then there's Utsumi, who's
    on the volleyball team. She's pretty cool. That's my type. You know,
    real outgoing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course right now he wasn't supposed to be indulging in idle emotions.
    But when Yukie said, &quot;Oh, yeah, here,&quot; and offered him a
    cup of water, Shuya couldn't resist whistling. He was in fact really
    thirsty. The cup was already there, on the side table beyond his
    field of vision.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>how
    impressive, Representative. You'll be a wonderful wife some day, no,
    a wonderful woman. No, you might in fact be a wonderful woman now.
    I've actually thought that for a while.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    took the cup, raised his head, and drank. His neck wound hurt as he
    swallowed and grimaced. But he drank it all.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    might be asking for too much,&quot; he said, returning the cup, &quot;but
    I think I should drink a lot more. And also...do you have any kind of
    painkiller? Anything. It'll help me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    nodded. &quot;Sure. I'll go get some.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wiped his lips and then said, &quot;It's amazing your friends
    accepted me. I mean, I could be an enemy.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    shook her head. &quot;We couldn't just let someone die. Besides...&quot;
    She stared into Shuya's eyes and smiled playfully. &quot;It was you,
    Shuya. I'm leading this group, so I forced everyone to agree.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Did
    that mean that she also thought there was something special about
    them ever since that time at the elementary school gym?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    probed further. &quot;Which means...that some of them were reluctant.
    I knew it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    come on. Given the circumstances.&quot; Yukie looked down. &quot;Don't
    take it the wrong way. Everyone's very agitated.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;
    Shuya nodded. &quot;I know.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    I convinced them.&quot; She looked up and smiled again. &quot;So you
    should be thankful.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was nodding when he noticed Yukie, who'd just been smiling, was now
    for some reason suddenly on the verge of tears.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    stared at him and said, &quot;I was worried sick. I thought you might
    die, Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was taken by surprise and looked at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    continued, &quot;I just wouldn't know what to do if you died.&quot;&nbsp;Her
    voice was now sobbing.&nbsp;&quot;Do you understand what I'm saying?
    Do you see why I had to save you, no matter what?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stared at Yukie's tearful eyes and slowly nodded. Then he thought,
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>geez,
    I can't believe how popular I am.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course this might have been a psychological result of their
    confinement. Under these circumstances, they were probably going to
    die soon—no, according to the rules, they were definitely going to
    die. He'd never heard of someone else besides the winner surviving
    the hellish Program—and now that the survivors were becoming fewer
    and fewer, maybe a boy that you liked &quot;a little&quot; ever since
    having an exchange in the corner of an elementary school gym might
    turn into somebody you'd &quot;die for.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No,
    that probably wasn't the case. She couldn't have opposed her friends
    unless she really cared for him. Besides, how else could she have
    trusted him?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    understand. Thanks,&quot; he said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    wiped her tears with the lower palm of her right hand. Then she said,
    &quot;Tell me. You asked about Noriko and Shogo. You said, 'we.' Does
    that mean you were with them?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    knit her brows. &quot;I get Noriko, but don't tell me you were really
    with Shogo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knew what she was getting at. &quot;Shogo's not a bad guy,&quot; he
    said. &quot;He saved me. Noriko and me survived thanks to him. I'm
    sure Shogo's protecting Noriko right now...There's something more
    urgent,&quot; he continued enthusiastically. &quot;I forgot. We can
    be saved, Yukie.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Saved?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded emphatically. &quot;Shogo's going to save us. He knows a way
    out of here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    opened her eyes wide. &quot;Really? Really? What is it?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stopped suddenly. Shogo had told him, I can't tell you till the end.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Come
    to think of it, Shuya had nothing to support it. He trusted Shogo,
    but he wasn't so sure his explanation would persuade Yukie, who
    hadn't been with Shogo. As Shogo himself constantly reminded him, she
    might suspect Shogo was using Shuya and the others.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    decided though to explain everything from the beginning.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    told her how he'd been attacked by Yoshio Akamatsu from the very
    beginning, how he'd been with Noriko ever since then, how he'd fought
    Tatsumichi Oki, and how, while Kyoichi Motobuchi was shooting at him,
    Shogo had saved him and how the three were together ever since. He
    told her about the escape plan, how Shogo was a survivor of the
    Program last year, how Noriko had a fever, and how they went over to
    the clinic, and then about Hiroki Sugimura. How Hiroki told them that
    Mitsuko Souma was dangerous. And then how they were attacked by Kazuo
    Kiriyama while they were on the move.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    Tatsumichi?&quot; After he was done she brought up Tatsumichi Old
    first for some reason, &quot;That was an accident?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right. Just as I described it,&quot; he replied and knit his brows,
    looking at her. &quot;What about it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    shook her head. She said, &quot;It's nothing,&quot; and changed the
    subject, &quot;I'm sorry for being so blunt, but I can't just all of
    a sudden trust Shogo. I mean, that there's a way out of here.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    still didn't understand why Yukie had asked him about Tatsumichi, but
    he figured it couldn't be all that important so he let it pass and
    accepted Yukie's skepticism.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't blame you. But I think we can trust Shogo. It's hard to
    explain, but he's good,&quot; he impatiently waved his uninjured
    right hand by his face. &quot;You'd understand if you were with him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    pressed her right fingers against her lips and said, &quot;All right.
    It sounds like we should at least hear him out. I mean it's not like
    we have any other option.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at her. &quot;What were you planning on doing?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    shrugged. &quot;I thought it was hopeless. We were just discussing
    whether we were better off trying to escape or staying here a little
    longer. But we haven't made any decisions.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then realized he'd forgotten to ask something else he'd forgotten.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    did you guys get together? All six of you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,&quot;
    Yukie nodded. &quot;I went back to the school, and I called on
    everyone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was surprised. &quot;When?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    would have to be right after you and Noriko ran away. Actually, I saw
    Kazushi Niida run...I really wanted to get back in time to contact
    you, but anyway, that's how I saw...those two dead right in front of
    the school entrance.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    raised his brow. &quot;Yoshio was only unconscious, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    shook her head. &quot;I wasn't able to get a close look...but he
    looked dead at that point. There was an arrow...stuck in his neck.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then
    Kazushi—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    nodded. &quot;I think so.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then asked, &quot;Weren't you scared there'd be others like Yoshio?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Of
    course the thought occurred to me...but I just couldn't come up with
    any other option other than forming a group. So I went to the woods
    in front. I figured if I hid there I wouldn't be seen. And if I was,
    then that was just too bad.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was deeply moved. He had to look after Noriko, who was injured, but
    still, he'd passed on the others and ran away. Hiroki Sugimura said
    he'd waited for Takako Chigusa, but he was a guy, and he also
    practiced martial arts.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wow.
    I'm amazed, Representative.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    smiled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    call Noriko by her name, but with me it's 'Representative,' huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    didn't know what to say. &quot;Oh well—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    worry, it's all right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    smile flashed across her face. Then she continued a little sadly,
    &quot;Then Yuka Nakagawa came out, and I called her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Were
    you able to convince her right away? Don't get me wrong—I think you
    have a good reputation.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    well.&quot; Yukie nodded. &quot;I didn't come back alone. I was
    really shaken up at first, but I just had to come back, and on the
    way back, I totally lucked out, I found Haruka. You know how Haruka
    and I are best friends.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. Haruka Tanizawa and Yukie were both on the volleyball team.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    talked to Haruka. When I told her we should go back she resisted at
    first, but we had weapons. I had a pistol in my pack. When Yuka heard
    the two of us call she managed to trust us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But...you
    can't necessarily trust someone who's paired up in this game.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    nodded. &quot;Yes, that turned out to be true.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    we decided not to have boys. Sorry. We discussed it and decided boys
    could mean trouble. So we let them go, and then there was Fumiyo—&quot;
    Yukie stopped. Fumiyo Fujiyoshi (Female Student No. 18) had died
    before their departure. &quot;After her came Chisato. So there were
    five of us. We also called on Kaori Minami but—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    filled in the rest, &quot;She ran away.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,
    she did.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized he hadn't told her that he'd seen her die. He thought of
    telling her, but decided not to. Now that Kaori's killer Hirono
    Shimizu was also dead, it didn't seem relevant and besides, it wasn't
    a pleasant memory. Also, as awful as it sounded, he couldn't afford
    to waste any more time talking about the dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    Yoshimi reacted the same way as Kaori?&quot; Shuya uttered the name
    of the last female student seat number, Yoshimi Yahagi, along with
    Kaori's and suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. Names of the
    dead. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Both
    of them. Both. of. them. Jesus.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    The smiling face of the man in the black suit made a sudden
    appearance in Shuya's mind. It'd been a while. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hey
    there, Shuya. So you're still alive? You're a tough one.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well.&quot;
    Yukie looked away from Shuya and pursed her lips. She squinted. &quot;That
    was different.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    so?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    took a deep breath. &quot;I said we should call on her. But some of
    the girls protested. You know Yoshimi was friends with Mitsuko. They
    couldn't trust her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    fell silent.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    said looking away. &quot;So she's dead. We let her die.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    said, &quot;No, you're wrong.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    looked back at Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It
    was beyond your control. It's no one's fault.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    knew it didn't sound very convincing, but that's all he could say .</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    grinned wryly and sighed. &quot;You're kind. You've always been so
    nice.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    nearly fell silent, but then Shuya had to say something, &quot;You
    should have called on Shinji.&quot; Yukie's group could have at least
    called on Shinji Mimura, who was at the tail end of the student list.
    &quot;He could have been trusted.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    sighed again. &quot;I thought so too, but Shinji didn't have a very
    good reputation...among the girls. You know, he was kind of a
    playboy. And his intelligence was kind of intimidating. You know how
    he intervened when Noriko was injured? One of the girls said that
    might have been calculated.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was the same explanation Shogo gave when he mentioned he'd seen
    Shinji.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Before
    we could decide, Shinji was gone.&quot; Yukie shrugged. &quot;In any
    case, we'd decided against boys. So we didn't call on Kazuhiko
    either.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuhiko
    Yamamoto, who went out with Sakura Ogawa, who despite his good looks
    was kind and unpretentious, and therefore must have been popular with
    the girls. Yukie's group decided against contacting him too, though.
    And given this policy, it was only to be expected there'd be some
    friction over taking in Shuya here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized Yukie only accounted for five of them. She hadn't mentioned
    Yuko Sakaki (Female Student No. 9).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    about Yuko? You haven't mentioned her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    nodded and looked back at Shuya. &quot;That was luck too. We came
    here yesterday morning...Nice fortress huh? Last night, I think it
    was around 8 p.m., Yuko just stumbled by here. She was totally
    terrified.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    stopped as if she had something else to say. Shuya was about to ask
    her what was wrong, but Yukie continued, &quot;In any case, everyone
    knows Yuko. So it wasn't a problem.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    summed up her account. Shuya thought of asking more about Yuko Sakaki
    but decided not to. If she'd been alone until last night then she
    might have encountered something horrible. Did she survive someone's
    attack, or did she see students killings each other, or did she come
    across a corpse torn up from fighting?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded slightly several times. &quot;I get it now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There's
    one thing </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    don't get,&quot; Yukie said. &quot;It's not a big deal, but Hiroki
    was saying he needed to see Kayoko Kotohiki, right? And that was why
    he didn't join your group.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was worried about him ever since he summarized his situation to
    Yukie. Hiroki was still alive and so was Kayoko Kotohiki. Did he
    manage to find her?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;He
    had to see her. I wonder why.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head. &quot;We didn't ask. He was in a hurry. We were
    wondering too—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he spoke Shuya couldn't help but wonder, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>did
    Hiroki manage to find Kayoko Kotohiki? If he did then—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    voice suddenly returned: &quot;This sound is your ticket out of here.
    If you're up for it, you can come aboard our train.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    opened his eyes wide and exclaimed, &quot;The bird call.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked over at Yukie. &quot;I know a way we can join Noriko and
    Shogo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. Then he struggled to move his body. He could explain later.
    &quot;I have to contact him now. I have to get going.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hold
    on,&quot; Yukie stopped him. &quot;You need to rest.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    can't. The more I lie around—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    said hold on. You might want to listen to the girl who's in love with
    you.&quot; She managed to say this as she blushed a little with a
    playful smile. &quot;We took you in here because even if you woke up
    you wouldn't be able to move. Your sudden burst of energy might
    terrify some of the girls.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    eyes opened wide. But then again it made sense. That was probably why
    the other girls let Yukie stay with him alone here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;In
    any case, just stay put for a while. I'll tell them everything you
    told me. I'll insist you and Shogo can be trusted and convince them.
    As for contacting him and Noriko, I can't let you do that alone.
    That's just too dangerous. I'll discuss that with them too. So you
    just stay here.&quot; Then she asked him, &quot;Can you eat?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    fact he was famished. He was worried about Noriko and Shogo, but he
    thought he should eat first. It would help his immune system fight
    against his gunshot wounds.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;If
    you have any food to spare I'd really appreciate it. I do feel pretty
    weak.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    smiled. &quot;We're preparing lunch right now. I'll bring you some. I
    think it's something like stew. Is that all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stew?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    this place is loaded with food even though it's all just preserved
    canned food and retort food. But we found water and solid fuel, so we
    were able to cook it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Awesome.
    That's great.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie's
    hand left the edge of the bed. She walked over to the door and said,
    &quot;I'm really sorry but I'm&nbsp;going to have to lock the door.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    sorry. There's someone who's terrified. So please, just wait,&quot;
    Yukie said. She smiled kindly as she opened the door and went out.
    Her two braids of hair swung like some mysterious animal's tail, and
    he caught a glimpse of a gun stuck in the back of her skirt.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a clacking sound from beyond the door. It might have been bolted
    shut. Was that how they locked him up?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    managed to raise his upper body with his right elbow and looked up at
    the window above his head. The window was sealed with wooden planks
    and light leaked in through the gaps. This was done to keep intruders
    out—but right now it also served as an ideal place to lock him up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    fingers of his near paralyzed left arm reflexively formed guitar
    chords under the blanket. The chords from that hit tune sung by the
    rock star the middle-aged man, the one who gave him his guitar,
    worshipped, &quot;Jailhouse Rock.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath and lay down on his bed. The slight movement was
    enough to send sharp pain through the wound in his side.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    Okishima Island lighthouse was old but durable. It faced north with a
    tower seventeen meters high, and the living quarters, a single-story
    brick building, had been built as an annex to the tower on its south
    side. The dining-kitchen-living room was immediately south of the
    tower, and further south was the storage room and bathroom. Further
    down were two bedrooms, one large, the other small, along with
    another storage room right near the front entrance. The hall running
    on the west side of the building connected these rooms. (Shuya was
    resting in the small bedroom by the entrance.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the corner of the kitchen-living room, which was at least as large as
    a classroom, was a small table that looked out of place. Yuko Sakaki
    (Female Student No. 9) was sitting on one of the stools around the
    table, slumped over the white tabletop as if she were dozing off.
    Unlike the other five girls, she had wandered around the island for
    hours on end, so a single night here had hardly alleviated her
    fatigue. No wonder. She had a reason for not sleeping at all last
    night.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    Utsumi's team used this room as their living quarters and slept here
    too. Someone had to keep watch at the top of the tower, but otherwise
    Yukie decided that everyone should stick together.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    behind Yuko, Haruka Tanizawa (Female Student No. 12) and Chisato
    Matsui (Female Student No. 19) were busily preparing the preserved
    food in front of the stove, where solid fuel was lit up in place of
    the shut-off gas. At 172 centimeters tall, Haruka was an attacker on
    the volleyball team. She and Yukie, who was a setter, formed a great
    duo. She had short hair, so next to the long-haired, petit Chisato
    they almost looked like a couple. The meal was a retort stew mixed
    with canned vegetables. Above them were planks of wood they found in
    the storage room and hastily hammered into the frosted glass window,
    which let in the dull light of the cloudy sky. The planks were there
    to keep intruders out. As soon as they had arrived Yukie and the
    girls immediately sealed off every entrance and exit from the inside
    of the building. (The front entrance was designated as their primary
    entrance-exit, which was where they took Yuko in, but now it was
    barricaded with desks and lockers.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    had a clear view of the other side of the room where there was a
    writing desk with a fax machine and computer. To the left of it,
    Satomi Noda (Female Student No. 17) was sitting on a sofa placed
    against the wall, while the table that had been in front of it was
    now used to barricade the front entrance. Along with Yukie, Satomi
    was a model student, and although she always seemed a little frigid,
    now she looked pretty exhausted as she raised her wire-rimmed glasses
    and drowsily rubbed her eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To
    the left of the sofa, the kitchen's side door connected to the hall
    that led to the front entrance. On Yuko's right, the far door on the
    other side led to the bottom of the tower, and the first several
    steel stairs leading up to the lantern room were visible. Yuka
    Nakagawa (Female Student No. 16) was up there, supposedly keeping
    watch. Yuko hadn't kept watch yet, but Yukie had told her that since
    the lighthouse faced the ocean, and since there was only one narrow
    path from the harbor behind the building, the rest of the area
    surrounded by mountains, it wasn't very difficult to keep watch.
    Yukie was now in the room right by the entrance where they'd kept
    Shuya Nanahara.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    Nanahara.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    felt the tremor of fear returning. Along with it the image that was
    burnt into her memory. The cracked head. The bloody axe removed from
    it. And the boy who held this axe.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a chilling memory. And this boy—Shuya Nanahara—was now in the
    lighthouse, the same building she was in. That was—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>No,
    it's all right. It's all right.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Trying
    to keep herself from trembling, she stared at the white tabletop and
    reminded herself, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>he's
    dying, he can't possibly wake up after so many injuries and so much
    bleeding.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Someone
    tapped her on the shoulder and she looked up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Haruka Tanizawa sat down next to her, she stared at Yuko and asked,
    &quot;Did you get any sleep?&quot; She was taking a break from
    cooking. Chisato Matsui seemed to be checking the cooking
    instructions, examining the package of preserved food. (Chisato had
    in fact been quietly weeping this morning. Haruka Tanizawa had
    whispered to her it was because of the 6 a.m. announcement of Shinji
    Mimura's death. Until then Yuko hardly knew Chisato had a crush on
    Shinji Mimura. Her eyes were still red.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    forced a smile and answered, &quot;Yeah, a little.&quot; It was all
    right. As long as she was with these other five friends she was all
    right. She was safe here. Even if that safety would expire when their
    time ran out. Still—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    brought up the matter. &quot;What you said about yesterday.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,&quot;
    Yuko smiled. &quot;It's all right now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes,
    it was fine now. She didn't even want to think about it. Just the
    memory sent chills down her spine. But in any case,&nbsp;Shuya
    Nanahara wasn't going to wake up again. Then it was all right. Just
    fine.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    smiled ambivalently. &quot;Well then, okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    Shuya Nanahara was discovered unconscious in front of the lighthouse
    yesterday, Yuko had vehemently opposed taking him in. She had
    explained (she was shouting rather than explaining) what she'd seen,
    Tatsumichi Oki's split-open skull, how Shuya Nanahara had removed the
    axe, how dangerous he was, and how he would try to kill them if they
    let him live.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    and Yukie were on the verge of fighting, but then Haruka and the
    others insisted they couldn't just let someone die, so they brought
    Shuya in. Yuko looked on, face ashen, keeping her distance, while the
    others carried the blood-drenched Shuya. It was as if they were
    welcoming a strange, scary monster that haunted you in your childhood
    dreams into your house. No, that's exactly what it was like.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    time passed, Yuko convinced herself Shuya was dying. After all, he
    couldn't possibly survive those wounds. Knowing he would die of
    course was unappealing, but in any case she managed to hold herself
    back. The one condition she insisted on, though, was that his room be
    locked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    continued. It was the same question they had asked several times
    yesterday. &quot;You say you saw Shuya kill Tatsumichi, but it might
    have been in self-defense, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was true. She'd been hiding in the bushes when she heard the thudding
    sound. By the time she looked, the only part she really witnessed was
    Shuya removing the axe from Tatsumichi Oki's head. Then she
    immediately ran away.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    other words, as Haruka said (which was based on Yuko's own
    description), Yuko had only seen the aftermath. It was possible he
    had done it in self-defense. However,&nbsp;no matter how many times
    Haruka and Yukie said this to her, Yuko just couldn't see it that
    way. No, she simply rejected the idea.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What
    do you mean, &quot;possible&quot;? I saw that cracked skull. I saw
    Shuya Nanahara holding that axe. The bloody axe. The dripping blood.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    thoughts revolved around this scene now. Yuko couldn't be rational
    about Shuya Nanahara anymore. It was like a natural disaster, like a
    flood or tornado. The moment Yuko began thinking about Shuya, that
    scene and her fear would just wash it all away. The only thing left
    was an axiom that was nearly visceral: Shuya Nanahara was dangerous.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    had her reasons. She abhorred violence. She couldn't stand it.
    Hearing a friend talk about a splatter film in Class B—had&nbsp;it
    been Yuka Nakagawa? &quot;Of course, it was funny, but, it wasn't a
    big deal, it should have more gory, ha ha ha&quot;—she felt sick
    enough to be taken to the school nurse.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was probably related to her memory of her father. Even though he
    wasn't a stepfather—he was her real father—he drank heavily and
    abused her mother, her older brother, and Yuko herself. She was too
    young back then so Yuko didn't understand why. She was never able to
    ask her mother why he was like that. She didn't even want to remember
    it. Well, maybe there were no reasons at all. She didn't know. In any
    case, when her father was stabbed to death by a yakuza over some
    gambling dispute—Yuko was still in first grade—she felt more
    relieved than bereaved. Ever since then she, her mother, and brother
    led a peaceful life. They could invite friends over. They finally
    felt safe with the disappearance of their father.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    she still sometimes had dreams about him. Her bleeding mother being
    beaten with a golf club (even though they were poor, this was the one
    expensive item in their home). Her brother being beaten with an
    ashtray, nearly losing his sight. And herself, suffering cigarette
    burns, paralyzed with fear. Her mother who tried to intervene would
    then be beaten again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    all of that was related, maybe not. In any case, Yuko was absolutely
    convinced Shuya Nanahara was dangerous.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Right?&quot;
    She heard Haruka say that emphatically, but her words didn't
    register. A chill ran through her body, accompanied by a vision.
    Everyone including herself, the six of them lying on the floor, their
    skulls&nbsp;cracked open, and Shuya Nanahara grinning with an axe in
    his hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>No,
    no. It's going to be over. Shuya Nanahara won't be around for long.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes.&quot;
    She looked up and nodded. In fact, she had no idea what Haruka was
    talking about. But in any case as long as Shuya couldn't recover
    there was no reason to throw the team off balance. Haruka seemed to
    be seeking some indication she was convinced.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Y-yes.
    It was just me. I was so tired too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    seemed to put Haruka at ease. She said, &quot;Shuya's a good guy.
    They're aren't too many around like him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    looked at Haruka as if she were a mummy exhibited in a museum. She
    had thought so too, until recently. Shuya seemed strange, but all in
    all there was something very likable about him. In fact, she'd even
    thought he was kind of cool.&nbsp;But any memory of this feeling had
    completely fallen by the wayside now. Maybe it was more accurate to
    say the cracked-skull scene had smothered out all her other memories.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What?
    What are you saying, Haruka? That he's good? What are you talking
    about?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    looked into Yuko's eyes dubiously, but added, &quot;So even if he
    gets up, don't provoke him, okay?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    was horrified. There was no way he was going to wake up. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>If-if
    that ever happened...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    a portion of her rational faculties were still intact enough for her
    to nod and say, &quot;I'm fine. No problem.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Good.
    I feel much better.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    nodded back, turned towards Chisato without getting up, and said,
    &quot;Smells good.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Along
    with the steam, the smell of the stew came drifting from the stove
    pot.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Chisato
    turned her head around and said in her quiet, thin voice, &quot;Yes,
    it looks pretty good. It might be better than yesterday's soup.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    had been crying over Shinji Mimura for a long time, but she seemed
    all right for the time being. Even Yuko could see that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    then, the door to the hall opened up. It was Yukie Utsumi. As usual
    she maintained her perfect posture and walked forward confidently.
    After Yuko's arrival, Yukie still did a good job leading the group,
    but she seemed a little tired. Ever since they took in Shuya she
    looked even more distressed. (It was in fact because she was on the
    one hand happy to see Shuya, but on the other worried his wounds
    might prove to be fatal, but this was beyond the scope of Yuko's
    perception.) Yuko felt like it'd been a while since she last saw
    Yukie so energetic, but now her face was beaming.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    felt as if a caterpillar was crawling up her spine. She had a bad
    feeling about this.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    stopped, put her hands on her waists, and looked around at everyone.
    Then she comically cupped her hands against her mouth in the shape of
    a megaphone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she said, &quot;Shuya Nanahara has arisen.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    and Chisato cried out with joy while Satomi got up from her sofa, but
    next to her Yuko turned pale.</font></font></p>

    huh. He says he's hungry too.&quot; Yukie nodded and then looked over
    at Yuko and said, &quot;It's all right. I locked the door to his room
    so you wouldn't have to worry.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    wasn't being sarcastic. It sounded more like she was doing what she

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But
    that wasn't the point,</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Yuko thought. No, actually she had considered it over and over last
    night. While she was certain he would never recover, what if he did?
    Then how would she deal with it? And...then the odor drifted by.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What
    timing. They were about to eat. Besides it wouldn't be that odd for a
    guy in critical condition to die suddenly, would it?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    forced a smile (indeed, it was impeccable) and shook her head. &quot;I'm
    not worried,&quot; she continued, &quot;I'm sorry. I was all screwed
    up yesterday. I won't hold anything against Shuya anymore.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    seemed to relieve Yukie. She took a deep breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well
    then, I guess I didn't need to lock the door.&quot; She smiled at
    Yuko and added, &quot;What happened with Tatsumichi Oki was an
    accident. That's what Shuya said.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hearing
    Tatsumichi's name, Yuko had a flashback of that scene which sent
    another chill down her spine, but she managed to keep her smile and
    nodded. An accident. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Well,
    I suppose it was quite an accident for Tatsumichi Oki.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    then said to Haruka, &quot;Hey, Haruka, can you go get Yuka? There's
    something I need to discuss.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    asked back, &quot;Shouldn't she be keeping watch?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    all right,&quot; Yukie nodded. &quot;The building is sealed, so we're
    fine. It'll be brief.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    nodded and entered the room leading up to the lantern room. You could
    hear footsteps clang up the steel stairs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While
    Satomi and Chisato asked in succession, &quot;How is he?&quot; and
    &quot;Can he eat the same stuff we're eating?&quot; Yuko quietly
    stood up from her chair and walked over to the sink.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a stack of several deep dishes right beside the steaming stew
    pot. Chisato and Haruka had taken them out of the dish cabinet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    dug her hand into her skirt pocket and touched the object inside. The
    weapon she found in her day pack was a telescoping spring baton, but
    what she now held was this item labeled &quot;special bonus,&quot;
    the item she had thought was useless. Even after she was welcomed
    here she didn't think there was much point in mentioning it. But when
    Shuya Nanahara showed up she came up with this idea, so she kept it a
    secret.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    the past, her father's violence, his terrorization of the rest of her
    family, ended unexpectedly. That was how her family finally attained
    peace.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    there was another threat. She had to put a stop to it. Once she did,
    she would be safe again. She wouldn't have to be terrified anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,&quot;
    Yuko called over to Yukie. Yukie, who was speaking to Satomi and
    Chisato, looked over at her. Yuko continued, &quot;Maybe we should
    bring Shuya his meal first?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    beamed a smile at her. &quot;That's a good idea. Let's do that.&quot;
    Yuko then added very casually, &quot;The stew looks ready, so how
    about I start serving it up?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    held the dish. The dish.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sure—oh
    that's right,&quot; Yukie said as if she suddenly remembered. &quot;You
    know, there's a medicine kit in the desk drawer over there. I think
    it has some painkillers. I should bring Shuya some painkillers with
    his meal.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sure.&quot;
    Yuko then let go of the dish. It clicked against the sink. &quot;Okay.
    Hold on.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    writing desk, equipped with a computer and phone, was across from the
    sink, in the corner of the room. Yuko made her way around the table
    to get there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Clanging
    footsteps descended the steel stairs. Haruka and Yuka Nakagawa
    entered the room. Yuka Nakagawa had a short-barreled gun resembling
    an expanded automatic gun with an extended stock slung over her
    shoulder. (It was an Uzi 9mm submachine gun. It was Satomi Noda's
    supplied weapon, but because it seemed like the most powerful weapon
    they had, whoever keeping watch held onto it.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    heard Shuya's up!&quot; Yuka said in her usual cheerful voice,
    placing the Uzi on the table. A little chubby and, thanks to her
    tennis team practice in the outdoor courts, tan, Yuka somehow managed
    to stay cheerful even in these dire circumstances.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes.&quot;
    Yukie nodded happily.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    you must be relieved, Representative,&quot; Yuka teased her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    blushed a little. &quot;What are you saying?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    come on. You're beaming.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    frowned and then shook her head. Suddenly realizing something, Yuka
    looked over at Chisato and fell silent. Chisato had lost Shinji
    Mimura, the boy she loved, and now she stared down at the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    hardly paid attention to this exchange as she took the wooden medical
    kit she found in the desk drawer. She placed it on the desk and
    opened it up. It was stuffed with various kinds of medical
    supplies,&nbsp;gauze, poultices. The only things missing were the
    bandages, since they were almost entirely used up to treat Shuya
    Nanahara.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Painkillers.

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Wow,
    it smells great,&quot; she heard Yuka say, trying to change the mood.
    But she hardly paid noticed to that either.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Painkillers...ah,

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    what is it?&quot; Satomi asked Yukie in her slightly husky voice.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    is it?&quot; Haruka asked.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    right. Let's see, where do I begin?&quot; Yukie said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was only when Yuka said, &quot;Let's have a taste then,&quot; that
    Yuko suddenly looked up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    turned around and saw Yuka lift the dish and put it against her
    mouth. She should have used the ladle if she wanted a taste. Instead
    she had to put her mouth against that dish, the one she'd sprinkled
    with the half-transparent powder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    turned pale. She was about to raise her voice, but it happened too
    fast.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuka
    dropped the dish and the stew splashed against the floor with a
    crashing sound. Everyone looked over at her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuka
    held onto her throat and coughed out the stew she had just swallowed.
    Then she coughed more violently onto the white table. Now the
    substance was bright red. The red splattered out in a circle against
    the white table and resembled the national flag of the Republic of
    Greater East Asia. And then she crashed onto the floor covered with
    stew.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yuka!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everyone—besides
    Yuko, who was speechless—cried out and ran to Yuka.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuka
    balled up on her side and coughed up blood again. Her tan face became
    more and more pale. Red foam spilled out the side of her mouth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yuka!
    Yuka! What happened!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    shook her body, but the dark-red foam only continued to spill out the
    side of her mouth. Her eyes were open as wide as possible, as if on
    the verge of popping out, but now even the whites of her eyes were
    turning red. For some reason—inflammation or broken
    capillaries—dark-red and black spots began appearing all over her
    blue face, transforming it into the mask of some grotesque monster.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    besides this, there was something else that was indisputable. It was
    obvious. Yuka had stopped breathing. Everyone fell silent. Yukie's
    trembling hand touched Yuka's throat. She said, &quot;She's dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Behind
    Yukie, who crouched down beside Yuka and Haruka, Yuko stood still,
    her face completely pale.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was shaking. (Of course it was very possible the other four were also
    in the same state.)</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It
    couldn't have been from food poisoning...could it?&quot; Yukie
    continued, her voice trembling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Chisato
    responded, &quot;I... just tasted it. Nothing happened... this...
    this... could this be...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    followed up, &quot;Poison?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    sparked it off. Everyone (to be more accurate, it was everyone
    besides Yuko, but the other four didn't realize this) looked at each
    other.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a thump. Satomi Noda had grabbed the Uzi and was now aiming it at
    the others. The other four, including Yuko, reflexively moved to the
    side or backed away from Yuka's corpse.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Satomi
    screamed. Her eyes behind her glasses were wide open with fear.
    &quot;Who!? Who did it!? Who poisoned this stew! Who's the one trying
    to kill us!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Stop
    it!&quot; Yukie yelled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    saw her hand reach for the gun (Browning High Power 9mm. This was
    Yukie's supplied weapon and because she was the team leader she held
    onto it) tucked in the back of her skirt. Yukie was about to move
    forward but stopped and stepped back. &quot;Put your gun down. That
    can't be.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh
    yes it can,&quot; Satomi shook her head. Satomi who always seemed so
    calm had completely lost control. &quot;The last announcement said
    there were only fourteen of us left. It's getting down to the wire.
    So our enemy's finally rearing its ugly head.&quot; Then she looked
    over at Haruka and said, &quot;You were the one cooking.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    shook her head violently. &quot;I wasn't the only one. Chisato also—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    horrible,&quot; Chisato said. &quot;I would never do such a horrible
    thing! Besides...&quot; She seemed to hesitate, but then she said,
    &quot;Satomi and Yuko also had plenty of chances to poison the food.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right,&quot; Haruka turned back to Satomi, then hissed at her,
    &quot;Aren't you getting a little too upset?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Haruka!&quot;
    Yukie stopped her, but it was too late. Satomi was now completely
    upset.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    was that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right,&quot; Haruka continued, &quot;First of all, you've hardly
    slept. I know. When I got up in the middle of the night, you were up.
    Doesn't that mean you don't trust us? That's proof, right there!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Please,
    stop it, Haruka!&quot; Yukie pleaded. She was nearly shrieking now.
    &quot;Satomi! Put down the gun!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    please.&quot; Satomi pointed the Uzi at Yukie now. &quot;Stop
    pretending you're the leader. So this is the act you put on after
    your plan to poison everyone goes awry? Is that it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Satomi,&quot;
    Yukie said desperately.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    raised her hand up to her mouth and stepped back in a daze. Her body
    was numb from the sudden turn of events. But she had to say it, she
    had to explain the truth, or else this...something terrible was&nbsp;going
    to happen.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    Chisato moved to the side table against the wall on the right side of
    the sink. There was the remaining gun—a Czechoslovakian CZ75. (It
    was in fact Yuka's weapon.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rattling sound echoed through the room. Chisato was shot in the back
    three times as she crashed against the side table, slid down,
    clutched onto its edge, and fell face forward onto the floor. There
    was no need to check. She was dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Satomi!
    What are you doing!?&quot; Yukie's eyes opened wide as she screamed.
    Her voice was breaking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    please.&quot; Satomi held her smoking Uzi and glared at Yukie. &quot;She
    went for the gun. Because she was guilty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    did you though!&quot; Haruka screamed. &quot;Yukie! Shoot Satomi!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    a clicking sound, Satomi pointed the Uzi at Haruka. Her face
    darkened. She seemed ready to shoot Haruka at any moment.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    looked anguished. At that moment she had her hand on the Browning in
    the back of her skirt. After hesitating, she must have intended to
    shoot Satomi's arm or some other part of her body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Satomi
    then quickly shifted the Uzi and fired at Yukie.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yukie
    was blown back with the rattling sound. Blood burst out of the holes
    in her chest and she fell backwards.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Haruka
    stood still for only a moment and then made a dash for the Browning
    Yukie had dropped. Satomi's Uzi followed her body and burst out,
    blowing off Haruka's side along with the fabric of her uniform. Her
    body slid against the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    table was in between them now. Satomi pointed the Uzi at Yuko. She
    said, &quot;What about you? You're different, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    could only tremble. As she trembled, her eyes were fixed on Satomi's
    face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a pop. There was a hole on the left side of Satomi's forehead.
    She opened her mouth...and looked down at her left hand. Blood burst
    out of the hole in her forehead, splashing against the inside of her
    glasses. Then it continued to drip downward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko's
    neck moved stiffly like some gadget as she followed Satomi's eyes and
    found Haruka, her torso raised in pain from her fallen position,
    somehow still holding the Browning.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Satomi's
    Uzi burst out. It wasn't clear whether she pulled the trigger
    intentionally or whether it was from her nerves twitching. Rows of
    bullets tore along the floor and pierced Haruka's body which got
    tossed over and back. A bloody mist burst upward, nearly tearing off
    Haruka's neck above her metal collar.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Satomi's
    body fell forward slowly and landed with a thud over Yuka Nakagawa's
    corpse. She remained absolutely still.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Completely
    alone in the room, Yuko just kept on trembling. Her body was stiff as
    a rock. With the look of a child wandering into a freakish museum
    exhibition, she gazed at the floor covered with the corpses of five
    of her classmates.</font></font></p>

    but when the sound was followed by an argument, he got up from his
    bed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    felt a sharp pain run through the left side of his stomach and his
    shoulder blade. Shuya groaned, but using his right arm he managed to
    get out of the bed and stepped onto the floor with his bare feet. He
    was only wearing his school uniform pants. The heated argument
    continued. He thought he heard Yukie shouting.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    walked over to the door and put his hand on the doorknob. The knob
    turned and as he pushed—the door seemed blocked. Through the
    one-centimeter gap he could see a wooden plank diagonally set against
    the door. As Yukie had warned him, they had constructed a makeshift
    bolt lock.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    grabbed the doorknob and shook it vigorously several times, but the
    door wouldn't budge. He poked his fingers through the gap, but the
    plank, set against the door, refused to move.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    the verge of giving up, he took a deep breath when he heard the
    all-too-familiar rattling sound through the gap. There were several
    screams.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned pale. Were they being attacked? But if that was K—in any
    case, something was wrong!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    managed to keep his injured body from tottering over. He raised his
    right foot and kicked the door with the heel of his bare foot, using
    the front kick technique he'd learned from Hiroki. But the door
    easily spurned his kick, throwing him off balance. He fell back onto
    the floor and felt a searing pain go up his side. He also realized he
    needed to pee, but that would have to wait.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	BRRATTA.
    More rattling. And then more BRRATTA.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned back to the bed, stood up, and lifted the edge of the bed that
    was made of steel pipes with his right hand. The bed landed on its
    side with a thud and the blanket and sheets slid off.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    dragged the bed, pressed one end against the door, and went around to
    the other end. He then shoved it against the door with all his might.
    The door made a cracking sound. One more shove.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Bang.
    Gunfire. This time, one shot.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    bed pummeled into the wooden door. The door bent in half with a crack
    and opened into the hall. Shuya yanked the bed from the front of the
    door with his right hand and let it fall against the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another
    burst of typewriter-like rattling gunfire was now clearly audible
    through the open door.&nbsp;Shuya came out into the hall. The shades
    were drawn on the windows that had been nailed shut with wooden
    planks so the unlit hall was dim. The entrance was on his left. There
    were three doors down the hall on his right. The far door was
    slightly ajar, and light leaked into the hall, forming what looked
    like a cold puddle of light.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    picked up one of the longer pieces of broken planks in front of the
    door, approximately one meter long. He dragged his aching body down
    the hall. It was completely quiet now. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What
    the hell happened? Did someone attack, or...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    cautiously approached the door. He peeked through the gap and saw the
    room with kitchen equipment where Yukie Utsumi and Haruka Tanizawa
    were sprawled out by the center table. Beyond them was Yuka Nakagawa
    (</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>what's
    up with that face!</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">).
    Chisato Matsui was against the wall on the right.&nbsp;Someone was
    lying face down in the shadow of the table. That someone had to be
    Satomi Noda, because the relatively thin body standing still with her
    back towards him and silky, straight, shoulder-length hair belonged
    to—unless Shuya was mistaken—Yuko Sakaki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    were several guns scattered around the collapsed bodies of Yukie's
    group. He was assaulted by the stench of blood splattered across the
    floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    froze in shock. That overwhelming numbness was identical to the way
    he felt when he saw Mayumi Tendo's body right in front of the school.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What
    happened? How could this have happened? Yukie who had just said to
    him, &quot;You might want to listen to the girl who's in love with
    you,&quot; was lying over there. Four others had fallen too. Were
    they dead? Did they die?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko,
    her back facing Shuya, didn't have a gun. She was just standing still
    like a Venusian suddenly dropped onto Pluto.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was in a daze as he slowly clutched the doorknob, opened the door,
    and stepped into the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    turn around. She gazed at Shuya with bloodshot eyes, but then went
    for the gun lying on the floor between Yukie and Haruka.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    also came out of his daze. He tossed the plank he'd been holding with
    his uninjured arm the way he'd pitch a perfect fastball in Little
    League. (He wasn't sure anymore whether such a game existed on earth.
    It seemed to take place on a distant planet in the remote Andromeda
    Galaxy where the inhabitants played this game using three arms out of
    five, although the use of one's tail was permitted in the final
    inning.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    body suddenly ached all over, and he grimaced. The plank hit the
    floor right in front of Yuko and bounced up. Yuko stopped as she
    shielded her face with her hand and fell back onto the bloody floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    dashed for the gun. He knew that in this chaos Yuko holding a gun
    would only make matters worse.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    shrieked and retreated. She got up, turned around, and ran to the
    other side of the room. She passed by the table and disappeared
    through an open door further down. There was a metallic clang. Were
    they...stairs?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    gazed over there for a moment after she disappeared. But then he
    dashed over to Yukie and knelt down beside her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    could tell her chest was ridden with holes. The blood was oozing out
    under her body already, and her eyes were shut peacefully as if she
    were sleeping. Her mouth was barely open—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    wasn't breathing anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ahh,&quot;
    Shuya cried. He reached out his uninjured right hand to her peaceful
    face. He felt tears welling up for the first time ever since the game
    began. Was it because they'd just talked minutes ago? Or was it
    because of what she'd said:</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    just wouldn't know what to do if you died....Do you understand what
    I'm saying? Do you?&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    tearful but relieved face. Her melancholic face. And now her oddly
    peaceful face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked around. There was no need to check. Yuka Nakagawa's face had
    changed color. A bloody foam dripped from her mouth. Satomi Noda lay
    face down, a puddle of blood under her head. Chisato Matsui's back
    was covered with bullet holes, and Haruka Tanizawa—her neck was
    nearly torn off.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How
    could...how could this be...</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked back at Yukie. His nearly paralyzed left arm supported his
    right arm so he could hold her up. It might have been a meaningless
    gesture. But Shuya had to do it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he held her body, he heard the blood dripping onto the floor from the
    holes in her chest. Her head hung back and her braided hair touched
    his arm.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Do
    you understand what I'm saying?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    burst into tears as they fell onto her uniform.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ungh,&quot;
    Shuya bit his lip and gently let her down onto the floor. He picked
    up the Browning Yuko had attempted to grab. He walked to the door at
    the far end of the room where Yuko had gone. His body felt incredibly
    heavy. It wasn't just because he was injured. He wiped his eyes with
    his bare right arm, which was also holding the Browning.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    entered. It was a cylindrical space made of bare concrete. The tower.
    This was the lighthouse. There was a thick steel column in the center
    and a spiral steel staircase winding around it. There were no
    windows, only a sliver of light from above.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yuko!&quot;
    Shuya yelled. He began climbing the stairs as he yelled, &quot;What
    happened, Yuko!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    wasn't there at the top of the stairs. But...he heard the sound of
    her scream &quot;AIEEE&quot; echo through the cylindrical space of
    the tower. Shuya knit his brows—and began quickly climbing the
    stairs. The wound in his side began to ache. He thought he might be
    bleeding because his bandages now felt damp.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    Sakaki ran out of breath as she climbed up the stairs to the top of
    the lighthouse. The Cyclops-like Fresnel lens was at the center of
    the landing, and there was enough space to move around it. She saw
    the cloudy sky beyond the windproof windows of the lantern room. On
    her left was a low door that led to a narrow balcony, and frantically
    she opened it. She was outside now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    it was the height, but the wind was stronger than she'd expected. She
    caught a strong whiff of the sea breeze.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    ocean was right there in front of her. Reflecting the cloudy sky, the
    sea was dull indigo, and the white waves were woven into it like some
    fabric. Yuko edged over to the right. The northern mountain was right
    in front of her. There was a small, open lot in front of the
    lighthouse building. On her left an unpaved road stretched out around
    the foot of the mountain, and there was a white light truck right by
    a barely functional gate in front of the road.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    held onto the steel handrailing around the balcony. The room she was
    inside only moments ago was down below. She saw the roof of the
    single-story building annex. Following the railing, she continued
    circling the lantern room, but didn't find what she thought she
    would—a steel ladder. Yuko never had the chance to keep watch so
    she didn't know the exterior of the lighthouse. There was no way out.
    She was&nbsp;standing, facing the sky. She was trapped now. Realizing
    this, she was about to panic, but she clenched her teeth and held
    herself together. If there was no ladder... then she'd have to jump.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was panting. She ended up returning to her previous position. She
    looked down again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was high. It wasn't as bad as leaping to the ground, but it was still
    high. In fact, it might have been impossible to jump at this height,
    but before she could make a rational choice the image flashed across
    her mind again. This time it was </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>her</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    head, alone, split open. Blood spraying up. Shuya's face covered with
    its blood. She had to escape. No matter what. She just had to escape.
    She had no time to lose.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    crouched down and slid between the haphazardly installed steel fence.
    Its bars were widely spaced. She got through. Holding onto the
    railing from outside, she cautiously stood on the edge of the balcony
    barely ten centimeters wide, but&nbsp;the view below her feet made
    her dizzy. It was way too high...jumping down was out of the
    question...it was just way too high...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    view suddenly shook. Her feet slipped. The side of her shin hit the
    concrete edge of the balcony (she felt her skin scraping off), and
    Yuko's body flew out into the sky. &quot;AIEEE,&quot; Yuko shrieked.
    Simultaneously, her hands groped around and managed to grab a thin
    steel bar from the steel fence. Yuko's body hung from the edge of the
    balcony.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding
    onto the railing, Yuko was panting. She'd nearly died.&nbsp;However,
    she took a deep breath and put all her might into her hands. First,
    she had to lift her body up and get back to the other side of the
    railing. Then she would have to figure out some way to fight Shuya
    Nanahara. That was the only—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    strong wind whistled by and shook her body. She shrieked, &quot;AIEEE,&quot;
    but it didn't do much. Her hands clutching onto the steel bar
    slipped, and now the palms of her hands barely managed to hold onto
    the edge of the balcony. Now she couldn't even reach for the steel
    bars.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was appalled to find her palms were oozing sweat. She was overcome
    with fear and panic. How, how, how, how could she be sweating now?
    Her hands...her hands were slipping...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    right pinky slipped off the edge of the balcony.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No!&quot;
    Yuko screamed. Then her ring finger. Then her entire right hand fell
    off the railing (she felt the nail of her index finger catch, but it
    peeled off and that was that). Her body swung, her left hand now the
    fulcrum. And now her left hand too...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ahhhhhh—&quot;
    As she screamed, Yuko was overwhelmed with a dreamlike sensation that
    she was falling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then she felt an impact run down her arm to her shoulder. Her fall
    came to a halt less than half a meter below.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Swinging
    like a pendulum on her left arm, Yuko gazed up...and then saw Shuya
    Nanahara beyond the railing extending his body, stretching his right
    arm out, holding her wrist.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For
    an instant Yuko gazed at Shuya's face, but then the next moment she
    screamed, &quot;No—!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course if she let go she would die, but it was Shuya Nanahara holding
    her hand!&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No!
    No!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    eyes wide open, her hair tossed around, Yuko continued screaming as
    she wondered, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>why?
    Why are you trying to save me? Is it because you want to use me to
    survive? Or, oh, I get it. You want to kill me with your very own
    hands!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No!
    Let me go!&quot; Yuko screamed. Any trace of rational thought had all
    but disappeared. &quot;No! I'd rather die here than let you kill me!
    Let me go! Let me go!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whatever
    he thought in reaction—or maybe he wasn't thinking at all—his
    expression stayed the same, and he yelled, &quot;Don't move!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    gazed up at Shuya again—and realized the bandage under the silver
    collar covering his neck wound oozed with blood now dripping down his
    bare shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    blood dripped down his arm and reached her left hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ugh,&quot;
    Shuya moaned. He gripped Yuko's hand tighter. His face was breaking
    into a sweat. It wasn't just his neck, his entire body was covered
    with severe wounds. Given how he was not only holding her entire
    weight with his right arm but attempting to pull her up, he had to be
    in incredible pain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko's
    jaw dropped. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Why?
    Why would you try to save me when you're in so much pain? That's—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Strangely
    enough, it suddenly all came to her. The black mist clouding her
    thoughts suddenly cleared as if blown away by the sea breeze blowing
    against her body. The image of Shuya holding the blood-soaked axe,
    looking down at Tatsumichi Oki's corpse, suddenly vanished as if
    shredded by the wind, and all her previous (although it was only two
    days ago) memories of the Third Year Class B classroom along with the
    cheerful expressions of Shuya Nanahara came back to her. How he joked
    around with his friends Yoshitoki Kuninobu and Shinji Mimura, how he
    looked so serious repeating a difficult guitar line while practicing
    in the music room, how he posed triumphantly at second base after
    making a perfect hit down the third base line during gym class, which
    she managed to see from the gym where she was playing volleyball. And
    then when she was pale from menstrual cramps, how he'd gently said to
    her, &quot;What's wrong, Yuko? You look pale,&quot; interrupted their
    English teacher Mr. Yamamoto, and called on the nurse's assistant,
    Fumiyo Fujiyoshi. How he looked so concerned then.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Oh
    no. Yuko finally understood the situation. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>This
    is Shuya. Shuya is trying to save me. I...why? Why did I have to
    think I had to kill Shuya? Why did I believe that? It's Shuya. And I
    always thought he was kind of cool...that he was really nice but no—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    a different thought occurred to her. The action she took and its
    results. Yuko once again turned pale.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I...my
    mind was all screwed up...and...and that's how I ended up—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko
    burst into tears. Shuya saw this and looked puzzled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya!&quot;
    she screamed. &quot;I-it was me! I tried to kill you!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked surprised as Yuko looked up with despondent tears in her eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I-I-I
    thought you'd killed Tatsumichi...I saw you two...and I was scared. I
    was so scared. So I tried poisoning your food...but Yuka ended up
    eating it...and then everyone...everyone...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then understood everything. Hiding in a nearby bush, Yuko had seen
    him extract the axe from Tatsumichi Oki's head after fighting him.
    She didn't see how Kyoichi Motobuchi and Shogo appeared afterwards.
    She'd only witnessed that one moment. She could have interpreted it
    as an act of self defense&nbsp;on Shuya's part or as an accident, but
    Yuko was too frightened to trust Shuya. And so she poisoned the food
    to kill him, but Yuka ate this by mistake...and everyone panicked
    with suspicion. The culprit, Yuko, ended up being the only survivor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    all right!&quot; Shuya shouted. &quot;It's all right, just don't
    move! I'll pull you up!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was nearly lying flat on the balcony, his body jutting out between
    the bars, but because his left arm was useless, he couldn't grab onto
    the railing. Still, he twisted his body, and finally managed to tuck
    his right knee up to his body so he could rely on his back. He did
    his best to hold onto Yuko's wrist. The pain from the wounds all over
    his body, his side, his left shoulder, and the right side of his neck
    was mounting. But...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    face soaked with tears, Yuko shook her head. &quot;No. No. It was my
    fault everyone...everyone...&quot; she said, and suddenly her hand
    began to pry his fingers loose. The tight grip he'd finally managed
    to get on her came loose. Shuya gripped tighter in response, but the
    blood dripping down from his neck suddenly made his hand slip.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko's
    hand left Shuya's. The weight on Shuya's arm suddenly vanished.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yuko's
    face receded—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    a thud, Yuko fell on her back onto the roof of the single-story
    building below. Instead of slipping from his hand, she seemed to have
    appeared there suddenly via time-lapse photography.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    body wrapped in her sailor shirt and pleated skirt was sprawled
    out...and her neck was crooked, which made her head look oddly
    disjoined from the rest of her body. The top-right side of her head
    spurted out a red substance in the shape of a shriveled up maple
    leaf.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Ah...&quot;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    Sugimura (Male Student No. 11) took a deep breath.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    heard the rapid gunfire approximately ten minutes ago. He'd been
    wandering around the northern mountain, but he quickly headed east
    toward the shots. Then...by the time he arrived it was already quiet
    at the lighthouse. He knew it was there from the map, but he assumed
    Kayoko Kotohiki would never hide there alone in such a conspicuous
    location, so he'd ignored it until now. He wasn't sure whether this
    was where the gunfire occurred. He looked down from the cliff over
    the lighthouse and saw a girl lying on the roof of the brick annex by
    the lighthouse. Even from a distance he could make out the red color
    and see that she was dead. The short hair and petite body resembled
    Kotohiki, as Megumi Eto's corpse did when he discovered it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    slid down the edge of the cliff. As he descended, the corpse on the
    roof disappeared from view. He reached the front entrance of the
    lighthouse. There was a pile of chairs and desks beyond the open
    door. Someone had formed a barricade, but for some reason this
    barricade was also torn down. He looked at the window that was sealed
    shut with planks and cautiously walked down the hall. (There was a
    room with a bed right by the entrance, and for some reason its door
    had been knocked down.) His detector responded. Six. Hiroki proceeded
    cautiously and stood frozen in the room splattered with blood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    bodies of five girls were scattered all over what appeared to be a
    kitchen. There was the female student representative Yukie Utsumi on
    her back by the center table. To her right was Haruka Tanizawa, her
    head nearly torn off (!). And further down Yuka Nakagawa, whose face
    had turned nearly black. Chisato Matsui was lying face down in front
    of the side table to his right, her pale blue face turned his way.
    And then one more girl was lying face down behind the table, covered
    in blood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    four girls, including Yukie, were clearly dead. But this one whose
    face he couldn't see was...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    cautiously checked the room once again. He listened for any sounds
    beyond the opened door on the other side of the room. There didn't
    seem to be anyone else hiding.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    tucked the gun in his left hand in back, walked between the bodies of
    Yukie Utsumi and Haruka Tanizawa, passed by Yuka Nakagawa's body, and
    walked around the table. The soles of his shoes splashed against the
    blood all over the floor. He crouched down beside the girl lying face
    down, put aside the stick in his right hand, and lifted her body. He
    felt a sharp pain from the wound in his right shoulder where Mitsuko
    Souma had struck him. The gunshot wound Toshinori Oda had inflicted
    on his thigh though was only a scrape, so there wasn't much bleeding
    or pain there. Hiroki tried to ignore the pain, in any case. He
    turned over the body.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was Satomi Noda. There was a red hole in the left side of her
    forehead, and her glasses, though crooked, managed to stay on her
    face. The left lens probably shattered when she fell. Of course she
    was dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    put her down and looked over at the opened door on the far side of
    the room. That was where the tower was. That led up to the lantern
    room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    other person on the detector was that girl on the roof. She was no
    doubt dead as well, but he had to check and make sure it wasn't
    Kayoko Kotohiki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    took his gun and entered through the door. There was a steel
    staircase. He quickly climbed them with hushed footsteps. Someone
    might still be up there. He held the stick and radar in his right
    hand, checking it as he went up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    were no new responses as he came out into the lantern room. Hiroki
    put the radar in his pocket, tucked his gun also in back, and came
    out onto the balcony around the lantern room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    put his hand on the steel railing. He took a deep breath, leaned over
    the railing, and looked down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was the corpse in the sailor suit. Her neck was twisted in an odd way
    and blood spread out from under her head, but the corpse wasn't
    Kayoko Kotohiki's. It was Yuko Sakaki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    gazed at the sea. There was a strong breeze. Six girls had all died
    here at once. There were no guns in the room, but given how they were
    wounded and how the walls and floors were ridden with bullet holes,
    he was certain the gunshots he'd heard had occurred here. The most
    logical scenario was that the girls somehow got together and cooped
    themselves up here, but then someone attacked them. The five girls
    were shot down there first, and then Yuko Sakaki managed to get this
    far and fell to her death without being attacked by the assailant.
    Then the assailant left before Hiroki got here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    given how they'd formed a barricade at the entrance—the planks
    nailed over the windows, every entry point probably sealed—why
    would they tear the barricade down? Did the assailant shove it
    away&nbsp;as he left? But then how could he or she have entered in
    the first place? Could there have been seven of them? And one of them
    had suddenly betrayed the rest—no, revealed his or her true
    intentions? No, that can't be. The other thing was that Yuka Nakagawa
    didn't look like she died from gunshots. She looked like she'd been
    choked. The blood splattered all over the table also didn't make any
    sense. How could that large amount of blood end up there? There was
    more. The door to that room right next to the entrance. Why was it
    torn down?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was no use trying to figure it out. Hiroki shook his head, checked
    the roof of the building, and returned to the lantern room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he descended the steel spiral staircase in the dim tower and gazed at
    the inner walls of the lighthouse, Hiroki felt a light sensation of
    vertigo as if the spiral movement of the stairs were internalized. It
    might have been from fatigue, but still...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    now there were six students less. Sakamochi said there were fourteen
    students left, as of the noon announcement. Then there were at most
    eight students left now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Was
    Kayoko Kotohiki still alive? Wasn't it possible she might have died
    between noon and now in some area he didn't know about?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>No</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Hiroki thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>she
    has to be alive.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even
    though he could hardly justify it, for some reason he was nearly
    certain. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Eight
    students remaining, possibly even less. But I'm alive, and so must be
    Kotohiki. This is taking too much time. It's been a day and a half
    since the game began, and I still haven't managed to find Kotohiki.
    But...I will eventually.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Once again he was nearly certain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he thought of Shuya's trio. None of their three names had been
    announced. Shogo Kawada had said, &quot;If you're up for it, you can
    come aboard our train.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Was
    there really a way out? And would he really be able to reach that
    station with Kotohiki? He wasn't sure. But at the very least he
    wanted Kotohiki to board that train.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Shall
    I offer you a hand then, mademoiselle?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    sounded like something Shinji Mimura would have said. Now he saw how
    Shinji could be good friends with Yutaka Seto. Shinji liked to kid
    around. The jokes were different from Yutaka's, of course. They were
    more sarcastic and at times biting. Shinji seemed to value &quot;the
    importance of laughing it off.&quot; At the closing ceremony before
    New Year's, when they were in their second year, during the regional
    education representative's dull speech, Shinji said, &quot;My uncle
    once said laughter is essential to maintain harmony, and that that
    might be our only release. Do you understand that, Hiroki? I still
    can't quite get it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although
    he could relate to it a little, he also felt he didn't fully get it.
    It might have been because he was young. But in any case Shinji
    Mimura and Yutaka Seto were both dead now. He could no longer give
    Shinji a reply.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he pondered these thoughts, soon enough he was back in the kitchen
    filled with five bodies. Once again Hiroki looked over the room
    covered in blood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    hadn't noticed because of the stench, but now he saw the gas stove
    pot and caught a whiff of the appetizing odor. There was no gas of
    course, so they were probably in the middle of cooking using solid
    fuel. He went to take a look. The flame under the pot was out, but
    there was still steam rising from what looked like stew.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ever
    since the game began he'd only had the bread the government had
    supplied (when he ran out of water he retrieved some from a house
    well), so he was famished, but he shook his head and peeled his eyes
    off the pot. He just couldn't bring himself to eat it. Not in this
    terrible room. Besides, he had to hurry and find Kotohiki. Hurry up
    and leave.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    staggered out into the hall. Not having slept at all, he was feeling
    dizzy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Someone
    was standing at the entrance at the far end of the long corridor.
    Because the hall was dim, this person looked like a silhouette
    outlined from behind by the light.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    leaped to his side before his eyes could even open wide and crashed
    his way into the kitchen. All at the same time, flames came bursting
    from the silhouette's hands. A row of bullets raced past the tips of
    Hiroki's feet flying out of the hall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    grimaced from the sudden surprise. He got up, crouched, and then
    closed the door and locked it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    gunfire sounded familiar. It was the sound he'd heard before and
    after that incredible explosion. After he escaped Toshinori Oda, he
    heard the sound of gunfire behind him—it was whatever killed
    Toshinori Oda. It was also the gunfire he'd heard when Yumiko Kusaka
    and Yukiko Kitano were killed. He'd heard the gunfire several other
    times. It all came from &quot;that classmate.&quot; Like Hiroki, the
    assailant had probably come here after hearing gunfire. Or maybe the
    student was here to kill the assailant who'd killed Yukie Utsumi's
    group. Or maybe—the assailant himself was returning.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kneeling
    down on the floor, Hiroki reached around his back and gripped his gun
    with his left hand. He'd found the bullets in the day pack Mitsuko
    left behind, so it was now fully loaded, but he couldn't find an
    extra magazine. Maybe Mitsuko had put it in her pocket. Colt
    Government .45 Single-Action Automatic. Seven rounds in the magazine,
    plus one in the chamber. He couldn't afford to reload the bullets
    individually. The moment he did he'd be wasted by the assailant's
    machine gun or any other gun on him or her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    back against the wall, Hiroki looked at the kitchen where the girls'
    corpses were. Unfortunately, the windows were sealed with planks from
    the inside. It would take too much time to tear them off and escape.
    He looked over at the door leading to the tower. No, that was
    impossible. It was too high for him to jump off the top of the
    lighthouse. It would be insane. He'd end up sun bathing right next to
    Yuko Sakaki. No, wait—what was this &quot;someone&quot; trying to
    do? Was he tiptoeing behind the door, approaching, or was he taking
    his time waiting for Hiroki to come out? No, he had to be in a rush
    too. He had to get rid of Hiroki before he might be shot from behind
    by someone else arriving as a result of the gunfire.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    was right. The wood around the doorknob was blown to bits. (In fact,
    several of the bullets exiting the door tore off the shoulder and
    side of Chisato Matsui, who was lying directly in front of the door.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    door crashed open.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    dark figure leaped into the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    it tumbled over once and got up, Hiroki realized it was Kazuo
    Kiriyama (Male Student No. 6). Ignoring the corpses in the room, he
    pointed his machine gun to the side of the door which was his blind
    spot, and immediately began firing away.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    five or six bullets tore through the wall the gunfire
    stopped...because he saw no one there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    was his chance. Hiroki swung his stick up and leaped onto Kazuo
    Kiriyama from above. At the last&nbsp;instant he'd decided to climb
    to the top of the high shelf installed beside the door. He'd decided
    against using the gun since he wasn't used to it and had tucked it
    away again. The important thing was to stop the assailant—who
    turned out to be Kazuo Kiriyama—from shooting anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    responded by looking up. He lifted the muzzle of his machine gun, but
    the handle of the broom Hiroki held struck Kazuo's wrist. The Ingram
    M10 9mm crashed onto the floor, slid, and stopped beyond the table
    where Satomi Noda was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    tried to pull out another gun (it was a large automatic pistol,
    different from the revolver Toshinori Oda had), but Hiroki, who'd
    landed and balanced himself, quickly swung the tip of his stick and
    struck this gun down too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>A
    rapid assault! I'll strike him down!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    stick came swinging down, but Kazuo quickly bent back and
    somersaulted backwards. He leaped over Yukie Utsumi's body with the
    grace of a kung fu master, and after tumbling once he was standing in
    front of the center table. By the time he was standing he had a
    revolver in his right hand, the one that belonged to Toshinori Oda.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    even Kazuo couldn't have foreseen Hiroki's agility. He'd immediately
    moved within eighty centimeters of Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yahh!&quot;
    Hiroki swung his stick, striking the gun in Kazuo's hand three times.
    It flew into the air. Before it landed on the floor, the other end of
    Hiroki's stick swung at Kazuo's face. There was a table behind Kazuo.
    He couldn't retreat anymore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    the stick stopped several centimeters before hitting Kazuo's face. A
    third of the stick flew by Kazuo's face. Strangely enough, he only
    heard it crack later. Kazuo had chopped off the stick with his left
    hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    next moment, Kazuo formed a spear fist with his right hand to strike
    Hiroki in the face. He was aiming for Hiroki's eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a miracle he managed to duck and dodge it. That was how fast
    Kazuo's fist was.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Hiroki had managed to dodge it. When he dodged it, he grabbed Kazuo's
    wrist with his hand that had dropped the stick. The next moment, he
    twisted his wrist back. Simultaneously, he kneed Kazuo in the stomach
    with all his might. The absolutely calm Kazuo gasped slightly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    his left hand restraining Kazuo's arm, Hiroki pulled out his gun and
    cocked the hammer back. He pressed the gun against Kazuo's stomach
    and pulled the trigger.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    kept on pulling the trigger until he used up all his bullets. With
    every shot Kazuo's body flinched.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    the gun's breechblock held up, the eighth shell fell onto the floor
    with a clink, rolled, and then clicked against another shell.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    could feel Kazuo's right arm and the rest of his body slowly going
    limp. His slicked-back hair and the rest of his head fell forward.
    Once Hiroki let go, Kazuo's body would slide against corner of the
    table and fall onto the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    right now Hiroki stood still facing Kazuo as if dancing a strange
    dance, panting, his chest heaving.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He

    Kazuo Kiriyama. The Kazuo Kiriyama whose athletic prowess was
    probably superior to Shinji Mimura or Shuya Nanahara's, who'd never
    lost a fight as far as he knew. He'd defeated him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    a sharp pain pierced the right side of Hiroki's stomach. He groaned,
    gasped, then opened his eyes wide.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    was looking up at Hiroki. And in his left hand was a knife digging
    into Hiroki's stomach.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    slowly shifted his eyes from this hand over to Kazuo's face. Kazuo
    stared back with eyes that were as always beautiful and cold.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>How...could
    he still be alive?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course it was because Kazuo Kiriyama was wearing Toshinori Oda's
    bulletproof vest, but Hiroki couldn't have known, and right now there
    wasn't much point trying to figure this out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    twisted the knife and Hiroki moaned. His left hand's grip on Kazuo's
    right wrist was loosening.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh
    no, this is not good...at all.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Hiroki managed to squeeze some strength out into his arm. He swung
    down his right hand that was still holding the emptied gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    bent right elbow struck Kazuo's lower chin.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    flew back and slid across the white table covered with blood. The
    blood stain that resembled the Republic of Greater East Asia's
    national flag now looked more like the stripes of the American flag.
    Simultaneously, the knife in Hiroki's stomach, after tearing off
    approximately thirty grams of Hiroki's flesh, was torn out. Blood
    came bursting out. Hiroki gasped, but immediately turned on his heel
    and ran to the door leading out to the hall.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    as he was entering it he heard gunfire, and the door frame cracked
    open. Kazuo didn't have any time to pick up the guns scattered on the
    floor. So he must have had a fourth gun (probably attached under his
    pants, tied to his ankle or something).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    ran, ignoring the gunfire.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    leaped over the scattered pile of chairs and desks. Right before he
    emerged outside he heard that all-too-familiar machine gun fire, but
    the shots missed him because he was crouched over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    sky was cloudy enough to expect rain, but for some reason it looked
    bright to him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    ran as fast as he could into the grove beyond the gate where the
    light truck was parked. He left behind a trail of red spots on the
    white sand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    heard the machine gun rattle again, but by then he'd leaped into the
    grove.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course he couldn't afford to rest now.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    began to drizzle. Rain washed over the bushes covering the island,
    and in the dim light a dark sheen fell through the drops of water and
    thick clouds.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    slowly wove his way through the bushes. The area to his right was
    open and offered him a view of the sea, which was dull gray behind
    the white curtain of rain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    now wore his shirt, school coat, and sneakers, which he found in the
    room where Yukie's group was. Raindrops falling off tree branches
    dripped onto his coat. He had the Uzi slung over his shoulder, his
    right hand on the grip, and kept the CZ75 tucked in front. The
    Browning and the bullets he'd collected were inside the day pack on
    his shoulder.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    left the lighthouse immediately, and as he'd expected fifteen minutes
    later, right when he began collecting wood to build a fire on a cliff
    near the northern tip of the island, he heard gunfire coming from the
    lighthouse. Despite the fact that the massacre of Yukie's group had
    occurred inside the lighthouse, he surmised at least two students had
    arrived upon hearing the shots and ended up fighting.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    some hesitation, Shuya started heading back to the lighthouse. It
    sounded like the all-too-familiar gunfire of Kazuo Kiriyama's machine
    gun. He doubted Noriko and Shogo would go out of their way to follow
    the gunfire, but there weren't too many students left. Supposing one
    was Kazuo, there was a good chance the other was Hiroki Sugimura. Of
    course, it also could have been Mitsuko Souma.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    the gunfire ceased immediately. Shuya stopped. He decided not to
    return to the lighthouse after all. Even if he went back, there
    wouldn't be anyone there. Or at best there might be another corpse in
    addition to the bodies of Yukie's group.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    began raining when Shuya had finished preparing two fires on the
    cliff rock. He found a lighter in the lighthouse, but it was
    difficult to get the fire going because of the rain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rain grew heavy, so Shuya gave up and left the area. Noriko and Shogo
    probably hadn't moved much. C-3 was forbidden, but the adjacent D-3
    and C-4 were still safe. They were probably in that area, so he could
    make another fire once he was in the vicinity.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    this thought in mind he began walking. That was when we heard the
    distant chirping sound of a bird as he turned westward on the north
    shore of the island around 2:30 p.m. Shuya listened closely and
    quickly glanced down at his watch. The seconds hand moved seven
    degrees, and the faint chirping stopped. Shogo had said fifteen
    seconds. Given the time it took for him to look at his watch, its
    duration corresponded to that length of time. Besides, he doubted
    there were many birds chirping in the rain. And he heard none of
    those little birds that he'd heard during the day ever since the game
    began.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    continued along the northwest shore of the island—and once again
    heard the same chirping. This time it was clear. Exactly fifteen
    minutes had elapsed since the last one—and it stopped exactly
    fifteen seconds later. It was Shogo. There was no need for the smoke
    signal. Shogo was using the bird call.&nbsp;The third fake chirping
    occurred only three minutes ago. It sounded close. According to the
    map, Shuya was moving from B-6 to B-5.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    rested a little, tucked the Uzi's barrel under his left wrist, and
    lifted his left arm. It was easier that way because he didn't have to
    exert his muscles. The watch hands, out of focus from the raindrops
    against the glass, indicated it was 3:05 p.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    chirping sounded closer to the mountain than it was to the sea. Shuya
    glanced at the sea, then moved towards and then up the gentle slope.
    As he looked up, he noticed that the northern mountain in front of
    him looked different, which made him realize he'd been moving along
    the foot of the mountain and was&nbsp;now approaching the western
    shore.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just
    a little more. He'd barely covered 1.5 kilometers, but he still felt
    woozy from all the blood he'd lost. The pain in his body was so
    severe he felt like throwing up—he really had to stop and rest. But
    he was almost there. Almost.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    made his way through the grove and his fatigue became overwhelming.
    Of course...he could be attacked at any point from the bushes. But he
    couldn't afford to worry about that. If that happened he would just
    have to pull the trigger of the Uzi.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    low bushes became sparse and then were cut off. Shuya stood still. It
    wasn't as if there was someone holding a gun, but there was something
    strange in this narrow opening.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    first it looked like two stiff gray clumps to Shuya. On top of that,
    they seemed to be moving. He stared at them. There were black pants
    and sneakers poking out of these two clumps.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    realized they were corpses. Two boys had died here.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    flash of red color flew up from the stiff gray clump and cried,
    &quot;KAW!&quot; It was a large heron-sized bird, its head drenched
    in red. The birds were feeding on the corpses!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    reflexively raised his Uzi at them. He put his finger against the
    trigger—but decided against it. He walked over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    birds flapped their wings and flew away from the two corpses.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stood still in the rain by them...and lifted his right hand up to his
    mouth. He felt a sudden urge to vomit.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a chilling sight. The birds had picked away at their exposed
    faces. Their red flesh broke out of their skin. They were covered in
    blood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    held back his nausea and somehow managed to look at them. He saw they
    were probably Tadakatsu Hatagami and Yuichiro Takiguchi. Then he
    noticed something about Tadakatsu's face, which was in worse
    condition than Yuichiro's. The birds weren't responsible for his
    deformed skull. His nose, unharmed by the birds, was also crushed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked around and found a bat lying on the grass. Even though it was
    washed by the rain, the tip of the bat was still tinged with red.
    Given the state of Tadakatsu's face, he was most likely beaten to
    death. With the gear of his sport— a baseball bat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Compared
    to him, Yuichiro's face was in relatively good shape. Of course...
    Shuya had a feeling his lips and eyeballs were gone by now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One
    of the birds landed on top of Tadakatsu's face. Then several more
    birds came by. Given how Shuya remained frozen, they probably assumed
    they were safe.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Safe?
    You got to be kidding!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    once again put his finger on the trigger of the Uzi...but restrained
    himself. The important thing was for him to get back to Shogo and
    Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More
    birds reappeared.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Were
    they feeding on the other bodies sprawled all over the island? Or was
    it just because they were&nbsp;near the sea?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Peeling
    his eyes off the two corpses, Shuya staggered around them and entered
    the bushes ahead. He heard the birds cry, &quot;KAW!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he moved, he felt the urge to vomit once again. By now he was getting
    used to people dying, but the thought of these birds, these sky rats,
    feeding on them...</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'll
    never sit on the beach and gaze peacefully at seagulls again. Even if

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then he heard that chirping sound again. He looked up. Large

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another

    sounded really close.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked around. The bushes continued along the gentle slope. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>It
    must be around here. They had to be somewhere near here. But where?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    he could think, the nausea he'd held back surged up. The two corpses,
    their faces messed up. And their soft flesh would be the birds'
    afternoon snack. Yummy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    knelt down on the ground and vomited. Because he hadn't had anything
    to eat, it was all gastric juices. There was a sharp, acidic stench.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    threw up more. A pinkish substance was mixed into the yellow liquid
    like a drop of paint. For all he knew, his stomach might be screwed
    up by now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    looked up. Reflexively, he pointed the Uzi over there. But the muzzle
    fell again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Between
    the shrubs he saw that thuggish face. It was Shogo. In his left hand,
    Shogo held a bow which seemed to be carved out of wood, and in his
    right hand he was about to put down the arrow fixed to the bow. That
    was when Shuya realized, oh, I get it, I must have gotten caught on
    Shogo's tripwire.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hangover,
    huh?&quot; Shogo said. His humorous remark was tinged with kindness.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a rustling sound. Noriko appeared behind Shogo. She gazed at
    Shuya through her rain-drenched hair, her eyes and mouth trembling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Pushing
    Shogo aside, Noriko dragged her leg as she ran to him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wiped his mouth and staggered up. He released the Uzi and extended
    only his right hand, hugging Noriko. On impact Noriko's body sent a
    jolt of pain through his side, but he didn't care. They were having
    their reunion right above some fresh puke, but that didn't matter
    either. Her body against him felt warm in the cold rain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked up. &quot;Shuya...Shuya...I'm so glad...I'm so glad...&quot;
    She was crying. Tears came streaming out of the corners of her eyes
    along with the raindrops falling against her face.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    gently smiled. Then he realized he was on the verge of crying too.
    Too many people have died...too many people have died in this game,
    but how wonderful, how incredibly wonderful these two&nbsp;were still
    alive.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    came up to him and offered his right hand. For a moment Shuya was
    puzzled by the gesture...but then he understood. He reached out his
    hand over Noriko's shoulder and held it. It was, as always, a large,
    solid hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Welcome

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Exposed
    rocks appeared where the woods headed toward the sea. Now a low wall
    formation of those rocks faced the sea. Shogo seemed to have worked
    on it with his knife. Two large branches had been stuck into the rock
    wall, and on top of them were leafy branches serving as a roof to
    block the rain. Raindrops came flowing off the branch tips.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    he was given strong painkillers that Shogo had brought from the
    medical clinic, Shuya told him about the lighthouse. Shogo boiled
    water in a can with charcoal, and its gurgling sound overlapped with
    the sound of pouring rain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    Shuya was done, Shogo said, &quot;I see.&quot; He took a deep breath,
    and put another Wild Seven into his mouth. He held the Uzi in his
    lap. They decided it was best Shogo hold onto it. Shuya held the
    CZ75, and Noriko had the Browning.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shook his head feebly. &quot;It was awful.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    blew out some smoke and removed the cigarette from his mouth. &quot;Yukie
    forming such a large group ended up backfiring.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded bitterly. &quot;It's so hard to trust someone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,
    it is.&quot; Shogo looked down. &quot;It's very hard.&quot; He
    continued smoking and appeared pensive. Then he said, &quot;In any
    case, I'm glad you made it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    recalled Yukie's face. He was alive. He was alive thanks to Yukie's
    group, but they were gone now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at Noriko, on his left. Hearing about the deaths of her
    friends Yukie Utsumi and Haruka Tanizawa must have been hard on her.
    Once she saw the water was boiling, she took out some dried bouillon
    Shogo must have found and tossed two cubes into the can. The smell of
    broth came drifting up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Can
    you eat, Shuya?&quot; Noriko asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at Noriko and raised his brow. He knew he had to eat, but he
    had just thrown up—and besides the images of the stiff gray lumps
    around Tadakatsu Hatagami and Yuichiro Takiguchi still flashed
    through his mind. (He hadn't told them about that. The &quot;lumps&quot;
    were at work only a hundred meters or so away from them. He only said
    that he threw up from the pain of his wounds.) He couldn't work up an
    appetite.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Eat,
    Shuya. Noriko and I already had lunch,&quot; Shogo said, cigarette in
    mouth. His stubble had thickened. He grabbed the edge of the can with
    a handkerchief, poured the soup into a plastic cup, and offered it to
    Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took it and slowly put it against his mouth. The taste of broth
    spread through his mouth. Then the warm liquid slid down his throat
    and into his stomach. It wasn't as bad as he'd expected.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    offered him bread. Shuya took a bite. Once he started chewing, he was
    surprised to find he could eat. He ended up eating it all instantly.
    Regardless of the mental state he was in...his body had been
    starving.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Would
    you like more?&quot; Noriko asked and Shuya nodded. &quot;A little
    more soup.&quot; He raised the empty cup. Noriko refilled it this
    time.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Taking
    the cup, Shuya said, &quot;Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    looked up at him. &quot;What is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you feeling all right now?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh
    huh.&quot; She smiled. &quot;I've been taking cold medicine. I'm
    fine.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at the side of Shogo's face. Shogo nodded, cigarette dangling
    between lips. He'd taken another antibiotic syringe kit from the
    medical clinic, but it turned out that was unnecessary.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned around to Noriko again and smiled back at her. &quot;That's
    great.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    she asked the same question she'd been repeating over and over.
    &quot;Shuya, are you really all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. &quot;I'm fine.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    fact, he wasn't, but what else could he say? He could see over his
    cuffs how his left hand had grown pale compared to his right hand. He
    wasn't sure whether it was due to his shoulder wound or elbow wound.
    Or it might simply be because the bandage was too tight around his
    elbow. He felt his left arm get stiffer and stiffer.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    had another sip of the soup and put the cup down by his feet. Then he
    called Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo,
    who was checking the Uzi, raised his brow and looked at Shuya. &quot;What
    is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    about Kazuo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he contemplated the events that had occurred since yesterday, the
    question that had been occupying him right before he split up with
    Shogo and Noriko suddenly came back to him. The gunfire he'd heard
    right after he left the lighthouse also reminded him. As he'd yelled
    out before, &quot;What's the hell's he doing!?&quot;—meaning, what
    kind of person was Kazuo Kiriyama?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    far as he could tell, Kazuo wasn't the only one willing to
    participate. Tatsumichi Oki, whom Shuya had fought, possibly Yoshio
    Akamatsu, and if Hiroki was right, Mitsuko Souma might also be in the
    same category. But Kazuo was absolutely merciless. His coldness and
    calmness. The strange vibe he always got from Kazuo suddenly exploded
    in this game and assaulted them. Shuya once again recalled the flames
    erupting from the machine gun, and the cold eyes behind them. He felt
    a chill run down his spine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    remained silent, so Shuya continued, &quot;W-what's up with him? I
    just don't get it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked down and tinkered around with the Uzi's safety device,
    equipped with a full-auto/semi-auto switch.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Didn't
    Shogo say there was no need to understand? Shuya wondered whether
    Shogo would give him the&nbsp;same reply.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shogo had a different response this time. He looked up. &quot;I've
    seen people like him before.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;In
    the previous game?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.&quot;
    Shogo shook his head. &quot;Not there. Totally outside of this game.
    You see a lot of things when you're the son of a doctor working in
    the slums.&quot; Shogo took out another cigarette and lit it. He
    exhaled and said, &quot;A hollow man.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hollow?&quot;
    Noriko asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;
    Shogo nodded. &quot;There's no place in his heart for logic or love,
    no. For any kind of values. That kind of person. On top of that,
    there's no reason for the way he is.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>No
    reason</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Shuya thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>or
    did he mean he was just born that way? That's—</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took a puff and exhaled. &quot;Hiroki warned us about Mitsuko Souma,
    right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    still haven't seen for ourselves whether Mitsuko's really up for this
    game. But from what little I've seen at school, I think Mitsuko and
    Kazuo are similar. The only difference is that Mitsuko's abandoned
    all reason and love. There was probably something behind that. I have
    no idea what it was. But Kazuo doesn't have any cause. The difference
    is crucial. There's no explanation behind Kazuo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stared at Shogo and mumbled, &quot;That's scary.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    it's scary,&quot; Shogo agreed. &quot;Just think about it. It's
    probably not even his fault. Of course you can say that about anyone.
    But in his case he probably could never grasp 'an unknown future.'
    Nothing could be more terrifying than to be born that way.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    I mean is that, even a dumb ass like me can think everything's
    pointless. Why do I get up and eat? It all ends up shit anyway. Why
    am I going to school and studying? Even if I happen to succeed I'm
    going to die anyway. You wear nice clothes, you seek respect, you
    make a lot of money, but what's the point? It's all pointless. Of
    course, this kind of meaninglessness might suit this crappy nation.
    But, you see, we still have emotions like joy and happiness, right?
    They may not amount to much. But they fill up our emptiness. That's
    the only explanation I have.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    these emotions are probably missing from Kazuo. He's got no
    foundation for values. So he merely chooses. He doesn't have a solid
    foundation. He just chooses as he goes. Like for this game he might
    just as well have chosen not to participate. But he decided to.
    That's my little theory.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    said all of this at once and then concluded, &quot;Yeah, it is scary
    that someone could live a life like that—and that we have to take
    on someone like that right now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    fell silent. Shogo took one more drag from his shortened cigarette
    and then rubbed it out against the ground. Shuya took another sip
    from his cup of soup. Then he looked up at the cloudy sky over the
    edge of Shogo's thatched roof.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    wonder if Hiroki is all right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He'd
    mentioned the gunfire he heard after he left the lighthouse. He was
    still worried about it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    sure he's all right,&quot; Noriko said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at Shogo. &quot;I wonder if we'll be able to see any smoke.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded. &quot;Don't worry. We can see smoke coming from anywhere on
    this island. I'll check periodically.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then remembered the bird call. It led him to them. But why did Shogo
    have such an odd thing to begin with? He was about to ask him when
    Noriko said, &quot;I wonder if Hiroki met up with Kayoko Kotohiki.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;If
    he did, we'd be seeing smoke,&quot; Shogo answered.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded and then mumbled, &quot;I wonder why he had to see Kotohiki.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
    came up when they were in the medical clinic. Shuya's response was
    the same. &quot;Beats me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;They
    didn't seem all that close.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    then Noriko said, &quot;Oh,&quot; as if she'd realized something.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked up. &quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know for sure.&quot; Noriko shook her head. &quot;But maybe...&quot;
    She emphasized her last vowel. Shuya knit his brows.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Maybe
    what?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    would be—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    interrupted them. Shuya looked over at him. Shogo was tearing the
    seal off a new pack of cigarettes and continued, his eyes glued to

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    Kotohiki (Female Student No. 8) was hugging her knees in the bushes.
    She was on the southern slope of the northern mountain, in sector
    E-7.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Evening
    was approaching, but the light coming through the bushes didn't
    change much. It just stayed dark. In the afternoon, the area was
    covered with thick clouds, and just two hours ago it finally began
    raining.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    wrapped a handkerchief around her head to shield herself from the
    rain. Thanks to the branches over her, the rain didn't hit her
    directly, but her shoulders were drenched. She was cold. And of
    course more importantly, she was terrified.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    had first hidden on the eastern side of the northern mountain peak,
    in sector C-8. So of course she witnessed Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko
    Kitano getting killed in front of her very own eyes. She held her
    breath. She knew that their killer was near, but she instinctively
    thought she would be risking more by&nbsp;moving. She stayed
    absolutely quiet. As noon and then night passed, she managed to avoid
    any attacks.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    moved twice in accordance to the forbidden zone announcements. The
    second time she moved was immediately after noon today, because the
    southern side of the peak, sector D-7, was going to become forbidden
    at 1 p.m. So the northern mountain peak was now surrounded by three
    forbidden zones. Her allocated area was definitely shrinking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    hadn't met anyone yet. She heard a lot of gunfire, sometimes in the
    distance, sometimes near. She even heard an explosion, but she just
    remained still and absolutely quiet. The announcement every six hours
    made it clear though, the number of her classmates was steadily
    diminishing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    noon there were supposedly fourteen remaining. And then there was
    more gunfire. Was it now just twelve? Or ten?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since
    the beginning of the game, Kayoko put the heavy gun (Smith &amp;
    Wesson M59 Automatic, manual included, but Kayoko of course could
    care less about the gun's name) down by her feet and massaged her
    right-hand fingers with her left hand. She'd been holding the gun all
    this time, and now the muscles in her fingers had gone numb. The palm
    of her hand was flushed red and imprinted with the gun-grip pattern.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    was completely exhausted, both from sleep deprivation and the threat
    of attack. Because she was too scared to enter a house that might be
    occupied, the only food she ate was the bread and water that came
    supplied with her day pack. She was hungry and thirsty. Her water
    intake was grossly inadequate. She did her best to save the supplied
    water and only drank over a liter since the game began. If there was
    one good thing about the rain, it was that she could collect water by
    putting the recently emptied water bottle under a dripping branch,
    but it wasn't even a third full. She would intermittently remove the
    handkerchief from her head and wet her dry lips with it, but of
    course this did nothing to relieve her dehydration.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    let out a long, weary breath, combed back her short, shoulder-length
    hair, and took up the M59 again. She was in a daze.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she sat, dazed, she thought of that face again. She kept on thinking
    of that face ever since the game began. He wasn't as familiar as her
    parents and older sister, whom she thought of as well, but he was
    very important to her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    just began learning tea ceremony when she first saw him at an event
    conducted by the school where she attended tea ceremony class. It was
    the fall of her first year in junior high.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sponsored
    by a government park for an autumn holiday, the tea ceremony was held
    outdoors for tourists. The actual practitioners performing that day
    were all adults, so Kayoko and other students her age took care of
    menial tasks, like arranging outdoor seating and preparing biscuits.
    He was one of the masters of the tea ceremony.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    arrived around noon, much later that day. He was good-looking, but he
    still looked boyish, as if he were still a college student. Kayoko
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>oh,
    this guy must be helping out too</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    But he addressed Kayoko's teacher (a 42-year-old woman) at her seat,
    &quot;I'm sorry I'm late,&quot; took her place, and prepared the tea.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    preparation was very impressive. He handled the tea whisk and bowl
    incredibly gracefully, and his posture was impeccable. Despite his
    age, he didn't look odd in traditional clothes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    put her tasks on hold and was gazing at him when someone tapped her
    on the shoulder. She turned around and saw her senior in the Tea
    Ceremony Club at Shiroiwa Junior High, the one who'd&nbsp;invited her
    to attend the tea ceremony school.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;He's
    pretty hot, huh? He's the grandson of the headmaster. Well, to be
    more accurate, he's the master's mistress' grandson. I'm a fan too. I
    mean, basically I've been going to tea ceremony class just to meet
    him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    senior informed her how he was nineteen years old, and how after
    graduating from high school he was already ranked as an instructor
    with many disciples. Kayoko's only reaction at the time was, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh,
    he's from another world, so there're people like him.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    That was all but then...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    began spending more hours in front of the mirror whenever there was a
    tea ceremony school event, or whenever she knew he would be appearing
    as a guest in her class. Given her age she didn't use makeup, but she
    did wear her traditional kimono immaculately, kept a comb in her
    hair, and carefully inserted her favorite dark-blue hair clip. Her
    flowing brows, and although not very large, curved eyes, and although
    short, well-shaped nose, wide lips, nicely shaped at the center, she
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sure,
    I might not be stunning, but I do look pretty mature....</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    reason she fell head over heels for this man adored by adolescent
    girls to middle-aged women alike may have been pretty simple. After
    all, he was handsome and intelligent, cheerful and
    considerate—basically the kind of ideal man you hardly believed
    existed. On top of that, he apparently didn't even have a girlfriend.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    had two important encounters with this man, although from someone
    else's perspective they might not have seemed all that special.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    first one occurred at the tea school's demonstration ceremony the
    spring she became a second-year junior high school student. The
    ceremony was held at the headmaster's home in Shido-cho near
    Shiroiwa-cho. Almost immediately after the event began, there was a
    problem. A special guest, the central government's regional cultural
    representative, suddenly began complaining about the tea ceremony. It
    wasn't the first time. They were government officials who announced
    their &quot;absolute loyalty to preserve the nation's absolute
    sanctity,&quot; but many of them in fact abused their power. Some
    would even request kickbacks in return for arranging increased
    national traditional arts funding which the headmaster would politely
    refuse, so this could have been a way to get back at them by stirring
    up trouble.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    problem was that the headmaster was absent because he was
    hospitalized. The heir who substituted for the headmaster and his
    heir were both so completely intimidated their incompetence could
    have led to the school being shut down. But the nineteen-year-old
    master saved the day. He took the belligerent official to another
    room, then returned alone and said, &quot;The official has left. He
    seems satisfied now, so there's no need to worry, everyone.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    said no more, and the attending established members of the school
    also refrained from inquiring any further. As a result the rest of
    the ceremony proceeded smoothly. But Kayoko was concerned. Knowing
    him, he could very well have assumed full responsibility, saying
    something like, &quot;I am in charge of today's ceremony,&quot; and
    if that were true then the official could get back at him by
    concocting a report and arranging his arrest for being a malign
    influence against the government (and as a result sending him to one
    of those &quot;reeducation camps&quot;).</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    the ceremony came to an end with no further interruptions, they began
    to clean up the area, and she waited for him to be alone. When he
    went to move the seat cushions, she decided to call on him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Sir...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    stopped, still holding the cushions, and elegantly turned around
    towards Kayoko. His sad eyes made Kayoko's heart race, but she
    managed to continue, &quot;Is everything all right, sir?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    seemed to understand what she was getting at and broke into a smile.
    Then he said, &quot;I appreciate your concern. It's all right
    though.&quot; Her concern was suddenly eclipsed by the thrill she
    felt in having her first real conversation with him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;B-but
    that government official looked so mean. What if—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    stopped Kayoko and said something sophisticated, as if admonishing
    her. &quot;That official doesn't necessarily get a kick out of doing
    what he does. I'm sure this kind of thing happens all over the world.
    But the way this country is, it twists people. We're supposed to
    strive for harmony and that's what the art of tea is supposed to
    accomplish... but it is very, very difficult to achieve in this
    country.&quot; Near the end, he almost seemed to be addressing
    himself. Then he looked back at Kayoko and continued, &quot;Tea
    ceremony is powerless. But it's also not such a bad thing either. You
    should enjoy it while you can.&quot; He smiled kindly, turned, and
    proceeded to walk away.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    was in a daze and stood still for a while. The unpretentious way he
    talked made her feel at ease...and even though she didn't completely
    understand what he was saying, it impressed her, and she thought,
    </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wow,
    he's so mature</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    any case, she might have made an impression on him because ever since
    that encounter he would always give her a warm smile whenever they
    met.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    second crucial encounter occurred during the winter of her second
    year. Kayoko came out into the old temple garden of another tea
    ceremony and gazed at the camellia flowers there. (In fact, she was
    thinking about him again.) Suddenly she heard suddenly someone from
    behind say, &quot;They're beautiful,&quot; in a transparent voice now
    familiar to her. At first she thought she'd imagined it, but when she
    turned around she couldn't believe he was there—and&nbsp;smiling at
    her. It was the first time he addressed her without any reference to
    teaching tea ceremony or official duties.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    so they had a conversation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you find tea ceremony interesting?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes,
    I love it. But I'm not very good.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Really?
    I've been impressed with your excellent posture during your
    preparation. It's not just that your back is upright. There's a kind
    of intensity.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    no, I'm really no good at all....&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    his hands tucked inside his sleeves, he still wore his kind smile and
    glanced up at the camellia. &quot;No, I really do mean it. Yes, just
    like those flowers. There's something strained, but there's beauty in
    that. Something like that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course, she was still just a child, and he might have only been
    complimenting a hobbyist dabbling in the school's tea ceremony. But
    that didn't stop her from getting excited. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Right
    on!</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    (She snapped her fingers only later in the bathroom.)</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From
    that point on Kayoko began to practice tea ceremony more seriously.
    She thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    can do it. Of course, I'm still just a kid, but once I'm eighteen
    he'll be twenty-four. That would totally work....</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    so that was her memory of him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    buried her face into her skirt. A warm liquid which wasn't rain oozed
    into the area covering her kneecaps. Kayoko realized she was crying.
    Her hand holding the gun trembled. How could all this be&nbsp;happening?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    wanted so badly to see him now. Sure, she was still a kid. But in her
    own adolescent way, she really did love him. This was the first time
    she ever had serious feelings for someone. She wanted a single moment
    with him so she could tell him this much. She wanted to tell this
    person—kind enough to describe her as &quot;beautiful&quot; even if
    it was only referring to her tea ceremony skills—&quot;I'm still a
    kid, so I may not understand what it really means to be in love. But
    I think I am in love with you. I really love you.&quot; Something
    like that.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Something
    rustled in the bushes. Kayoko looked up. She wiped her eyes with her
    left hand and got up. Her feet moved automatically and took a step
    back from the source of the sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    boy in a school coat—Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No. 11). His
    face and torso emerged from the bushes. The sleeves of his coat and
    shirt were torn off, revealing his right arm. The white cloth wrapped
    around his shoulder was stained with blood and—perhaps it was
    because of the rain—it oozed pink. And his hand was holding a gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki's
    jaw dropped, but what really caught her attention when she saw his
    grimy face were his eyes. They were gleaming.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    felt a sudden surge of fear. How could she have not noticed sooner
    before he got this close. How—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Kotohiki—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    let out a shriek and turned on her heels. She entered the bushes. She
    didn't care about the branches scraping against her face and hair, or
    getting drenched in the rain. She just wanted to escape. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He'll
    kill me!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    made her way through the bushes. There was a twisting path
    approximately two meters wide. Kayoko instinctively decided to run
    down there. If she ran uphill, he would catch up, but if she ran down
    then maybe...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    heard a rustling sound behind her. &quot;Kotohiki!&quot; It was
    Hiroki's voice. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>He's
    coming after me!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    summoned all her strength from her tired body and ran as fast as she
    could. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    can't believe this, I should have been jogging instead of learning
    tea ceremony if I'd known this was going to happen.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Kotohiki!
    Stop! Kotohiki!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If
    she had been calmer—that is, if this were a scene in a movie and
    she were in the theater watching the actor performing as she munched
    on some popcorn—then it would have been obvious he was pleading
    with her. But right now it sounded like he was saying: &quot;Kotohiki!
    You better stop! I'm gonna kill you!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    wasn't going to stop. The path forked. She took the left one.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    area opened up on her left. Rows of tangerine trees spread out in the
    dull light coming through the silky rain. Beyond them was a thicket
    of short trees. If she could enter that area—but no, it's
    impossible, she thought. She had at least fifty more meters to get
    there. It was hopeless. While she struggled through the uneven rows
    of tangerine trees, Hiroki Sugimura would catch up to her and shoot
    her from behind with his gun.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    clenched her teeth. She didn't want to, but she had to. After all, he
    was trying to kill her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    stopped on her right foot and spun around to her left.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    the time she had turned around the gun was in her hands. That thing
    called the safety had been released ever since she'd read the manual.
    The manual said you didn't have to raise the hammer, all you had to
    do was pull the trigger. The rest was up to her.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Less

    stopped approximately two meters away from him. There was a small

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Now
    listen.&quot; He lay on the messy path ridden now with puddles as he
    said painfully, somehow fixing his eyes on Kayoko, &quot;You have to
    burn some fresh wood. Build...two fires. I have a lighter in my
    pocket. Use that, then you'll hear a bird call.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    heard him, but she had no idea what he was talking about. She had no

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    continued. &quot;Follow that bird call. Then you'll find Shuya

    got that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;W-what?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    awkwardly moved his right arm, pulled out a small lighter from his
    school coat pocket, and tossed it over to Kayoko. Then he painfully
    closed his eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Okay,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki

    have heard the shot. Go!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    as if fitting the pieces of a complex jigsaw puzzle into place,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    dropped the gun and fell on her knees beside him. She scraped her

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    burst into tears. Sure, there was something intimidating about Hiroki
    Sugimura. He seemed tough since he studied martial arts, plus he
    didn't talk much, and when he did he was always gruff. When he spoke
    to other boys, like Shinji Mimura and Shuya Nanahara, he would smile
    but otherwise he looked grumpy. She also heard he was going out with
    Takako Chigusa, and they looked so close. Kayoko only thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    don't get Takako's taste, I wonder maybe if you're that pretty,
    you're attracted to someone intimidating.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;That
    was her impression of him. So in this situation where her classmates
    were being killed off one by one she was absolutely terrified of
    Hiroki Sugimura. But then it turned out...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    closed his eyes again and said, &quot;It's all right.&quot; He was
    smiling. He looked content. &quot;I was going to die soon anyway.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    then finally noticed he had another wound on his side, soaked in
    liquid that wasn't rain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    go now. Please.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    sobbed convulsively and touched his neck gently. &quot;Let's go
    together. Okay? Stand.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    opened his eyes and looked at her. He seemed to be smiling. &quot;Forget
    about me,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm just glad I got to see you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?&quot;
    Kayoko opened her tear-stained eyes wide. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What?
    What did you just say?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    &quot;W-what do you mean...&quot; Her voice was trembling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    exhaled deeply, as if to bear the pain, or maybe it was a long sigh.
    &quot;If I tell you, will you go?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What?
    I don't get it. What do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    said without hesitating, &quot;I love you, Kotohiki. I've loved you
    for a real long time.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    once again didn't understand Hiroki. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>What's
    he talking about?</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    continued. He was looking up at the sky raining down on them. &quot;That's
    all I wanted to tell you. Now...go.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    I thought you and Takako—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    looked into her eyes again. He said, &quot;You're the one.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    finally got it. She was blown away as if struck by a huge wrecking

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Love,

    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    breath was raspy. She kept on getting choked up, but finally she
    managed to cry out, &quot;Hiroki! Hiroki!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hurry,&quot;
    Hiroki said and coughed out a mist of blood, spraying Kayoko's face.
    Hiroki opened his eyes again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki...I...I...I...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    body was supposedly dehydrated from lack of water, but the tears kept
    on gushing out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    all right,&quot; Hiroki said kindly. He closed his eyes slowly.
    &quot;Kayoko—&quot; he called her by her first name as if it were a
    precious treasure. It was probably the first time he had ever called
    her by her first name. &quot;I don't mind at all...dying because of
    you. So please, please go. Or else...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    kept on crying, waiting for Hiroki to continue. Or else?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiroki
    didn't say anything. Kayoko slowly reached out for him. She held his
    shoulders and shook them. &quot;Hiroki!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    a TV drama when someone died their words would be cut off, like, &quot;Or
    el—&quot; but Hiroki managed to say in a painful but clear voice,
    &quot;Or else.&quot; So there had to be more. Or else...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki!
    Hey, Hiroki!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kayoko
    shook his body one more time. Then she finally realized he was dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    she realized this, the dam restraining her torrent of emotions

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;AHHH!&quot;
    On her knees, Kayoko fell over Hiroki's body and cried.</font></font></p>

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No,

    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    Kayoko recalled a scene. It was when they were doing their cleaning
    tasks. Kayoko was wiping the blackboard with a wet rag and when she
    couldn't reach the top, Hiroki, who had been slacking off, rested his
    chin against his hands that were holding the upright broom as if it
    were a cane, and said, &quot;You're too short, Kotohiki.&quot; He
    took the rag from her and wiped the area she couldn't reach.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The

    gun. But I couldn't tell. I wasn't able to understand. I am so

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another
    memory came flashing by.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When
    she was telling some of her classmate friends about &quot;that guy,&quot;
    Hiroki, who was nearby looking out&nbsp;the window, muttered, &quot;You're
    being foolish, getting so worked up like that.&quot; It made her mad
    at the time, but in fact he was right, she was being foolish. And
    yet...and yet Hiroki told her he'd cherished this fool.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She
    simply couldn't stop crying. She pressed her cheek against his warm
    cheek and continued to sob. Hiroki told her to go, but she couldn't
    bring herself to do that. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'm
    going to keep on crying, I'm going to cry over the dedication (it was
    irreplaceable) of this boy who loved me and my foolishness (I was
    such a kid thinking I was actually in the running for &quot;that
    guy&quot;), I'm going to keep on crying. Even if it was suicidal in

    <p class="western" >

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	BAM
    BAM, two dry pops formed two holes in Kayoko's right temple. Kayoko's

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then

    mother, who was trying to take me to do &quot;it&quot; again and
    accidentally ended up killing her? After getting rid of all the
    evidence and doing everything to make it look like a break-in, I sat
    on a swing in the park. From that point on? Or after being taken in
    by distant relatives, I was repeatedly harassed by their kid, and
    when the kid accidentally fell from the roof, the mother accused me

    wanted to say something, but he was speechless. Shogo began laughing.
    Clacking up, really. Despite the urge to protest, Shuya ended up
    going along with it and chuckled too. Noriko was smiling too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a brief but wonderful moment. It was the kind of conversation and
    laughter you'd share with your&nbsp;longtime friends, hanging out
    with them after school at your favorite cafe Of course, looming over
    them was the feeling that they were all here only after attending a
    friend's funeral.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    smiling, Shogo looked down at his watch and went outside to check
    again for a signal from Hiroki.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    grinned and looked at Shuya. &quot;Shogo likes to kid around.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    smiled. &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; He squinted at the open space.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    might have been jealous.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" ><br/>
    
    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked back at Noriko again. He was about to tell her in a joking
    way, &quot;I may have been jealous.&quot; Then Noriko would probably
    laugh and say, &quot;Yeah right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    returned to the front of the roof. His stubbly face was moist with
    raindrops. &quot;I see smoke,&quot; he said and immediately turned
    around.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    quickly got up. He helped Noriko up with his uninjured right arm.
    They walked to where Shogo was standing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rain was light now, so he could make out the smoke drifting in the
    sky. As he followed Shogo's eyes...he saw a white column of smoke on
    the opposite side of the northern mountain. Two columns, in fact.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Right
    on!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    thinking, Shuya gave a little holler out as if singing a rock and
    roll song. His eyes met Noriko's. Noriko, no less enthusiastic, broke
    into a grin and said, &quot;So Hiroki's safe.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took out the bird call from his pocket and teaked it as he observed
    the smoke. The cheerful chirping of a little bird rose and spread out
    into the rain covering the island. As he continued, Shogo checked his
    watch. Fifteen seconds later he stopped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    then looked over at them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Let's
    wait a little more here. My guess is he won't hear this sound unless
    he's close. It'll take time.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    returned underneath the roof.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hiroki
    probably found Kayoko,&quot; Noriko said. Shuya was about to nod but
    stopped when he saw Shogo's mouth stiffen. Noriko also stopped
    smiling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Shuya said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked up. Then he shook his head. &quot;It's nothing. I just think
    things might not be what they seem.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh?
    But...&quot; Shuya raised his opened right palm. &quot;Hiroki would
    never give up though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded. &quot;That might be true.&quot; He stopped and then looked
    away from them. &quot;But he might have only found Kayoko Kotohiki
    dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya's
    face became tense. He was right. Kotohiki seemed to be alive up until
    noon...but there was all that gunfire. They'd just heard those single
    shots. After searching around for two weeks, Hiroki might have ended
    up discovering Kayoko Kotohiki had died.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    continued, &quot;Or there might have been a totally different
    outcome.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took out a pack of cigarettes and answered curtly, &quot;It's very
    possible Kayoko didn't trust Hiroki.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko both fell silent.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    lit his cigarette and continued, &quot;Well, in any case, let's just
    hope Hiroki can make it back here. We'll see then whether he's with
    Kayoko or not.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was hoping Hiroki would return with Kayoko Kotohiki. Then there would
    be five of them. Five of them could escape.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only
    five.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then recalled that Mizuho Inada was still alive, at least she had
    been at noon.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    glanced at Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Inada
    is still alive. I wonder if we can't contact her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged. &quot;I keep on saying this, but it's best not to trust the
    others too much in this game. To be honest, nothing against Hiroki,
    but I don't necessarily trust Kotohiki either.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    bit his lip. &quot;I know but—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Well,
    if we can afford to, then I'll come up with some way to contact
    Mizuho, but,&quot; he blew out smoke, &quot;don't forget, we may not
    be around to do that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    had said, &quot;At the very end. Once everyone else is dead, there's
    a way out.&quot; That meant no matter what, they would have to
    confront Kazuo again and also take on Mitsuko Souma. He wasn't sure
    about Mitsuko, but there would be no way around fighting Kazuo. There
    was no way Kazuo could die easily, which meant that everyone in
    Shuya's trio might not survive fighting him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    puffed on his shortened cigarette and said, &quot;I'm going to ask
    you again, Shuya.&quot; He exhaled a puff of smoke and continued to
    stare at Shuya, &quot;Even if we manage to hook up with Hiroki, we're
    probably going to have to fight Kazuo again and Mitsuko. Are you
    prepared to be merciless?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So
    that's what it came down to. They could afford to contact Mizuho
    Inada only after they'd defeated Kazuo and Mitsuko. Although he
    wasn't comfortable with how he'd gotten used to the idea of killing
    his classmates no matter how extreme the circumstances were...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded and responded, &quot;I am.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    tweaked the bird call. It was the third time. The rain was now
    lightening up, and the drops falling off the edge of the roof became
    less frequent. The time was already past 5 p.m.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    he heard the same bird sound four times Shuya managed to join up with

    have that information.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    returned under the roof and lit a Wild Seven.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    blew out smoke and asked out of the blue, &quot;Where do you want to
    go?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked at Shogo, who was sitting on the other side of Noriko. Shogo
    turned towards him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    forgot to mention it, but I have a connection. Once we get out of

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Who's
    that?&quot; Shuya asked and Shogo nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;A
    friend of my dad's,&quot; he continued. &quot;He'll see to it that
    you get out of this country... I'm assuming you'll want to do that.
    You'll get killed if you stay in this country. You'll be hunted down
    like rats.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Escape
    the country,&quot; Noriko said, surprised. &quot;We can really do
    that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    also asked, &quot;Who's this friend of your father's?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at them, as if considering something as he held the cigarette
    to his mouth with his left hand. He removed the cigarette from his
    mouth and said, &quot;Right now isn't a good time to tell you.&quot;
    Then he continued, &quot;In case we end up splitting up during our
    escape it'd be bad if either of you get caught and share our plans
    with the government. It's not that I don't trust you. But once they
    torture you, you'll eventually end up confessing. So I'll be in
    charge of getting us there.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought about it and then nodded. It seemed like he was making the
    right call.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But,
    let's see,&quot; Shogo said. He bit his cigarette and pulled out a
    piece of paper from his pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    looked like the sheet on which they'd all written that statement, &quot;We
    shall kill each other.&quot; Shogo tore it in two and then scribbled
    onto both pieces. He folded them up neatly and offered one to Shuya
    and the other to Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    this?&quot; Shuya asked and began opening it up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stopped him, saying, &quot;Hold on. Don't look at it now. It's our
    contact method, just in any case. The time and locations are written
    on it. Go to that place and time every day. I'll do my best to get
    there too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    can't look at it now?&quot; Noriko asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Nope,&quot;
    Shogo said. &quot;Look at it only in case we end up splitting up. In
    other words...your note and Shuya's have different information. It's
    best you two don't know what's on each other's note. Just in case one
    of you gets caught.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko looked at each other. Then Shuya turned to Shogo. &quot;I'm
    going to be with Noriko no matter what.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    know I know,&quot; Shogo grinned wryly, &quot;but we can't rule out
    the possibility you might get separated again, like you were when
    Kazuo attacked us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    pursed his lips and looked over at Shogo...but ended up nodding. He
    exchanged glances with Noriko and put away the memo. So did Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was true. Anything could happen. Escaping this island in the first
    place was going to be incredibly difficult. But if that were the case
    then shouldn't he and Noriko also come up with their own place and
    time to meet? Without telling Shogo? Then again, if Shogo ended up
    getting caught by the government then their situation would be
    hopeless anyway.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    asked, &quot;So where do you want to go?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    recalled how Shogo wanted to know their ideal destinations once they
    fled the country. He folded his arms and thought about it. Then he
    said, &quot;It'd have to be America. It's where rock came from. I
    always wanted to go there, at least once.&quot; He thought, I </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>didn't
    think I'd be escaping there, though.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    see.&quot; Shogo nodded. &quot;What about you, Noriko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't really have anywhere in mind but...&quot; Noriko said and
    glanced over at Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded back. &quot;Let's go together. All right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh...&quot;
    Noriko's eyes opened wide. Then she formed a smile and nodded. &quot;Sure,
    if you're all right with that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled. He took another drag from his cigarette and asked, &quot;What
    will you do once you get there?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought about it. Then he answered with a grin, &quot;I'll be busking
    with my guitar. At least I'll make some change.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    chuckled, &quot;Huh.&quot; Then he said, &quot;You best be a rocker.
    You're talented. From what I hear, in that country the odds aren't
    stacked so high against you even if you're an immigrant or exile.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath and gave him a skeptical grin. &quot;I'm not that
    talented. I don't have what it takes to be a pro.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    don't know about that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    smiled and shook his head. Then he looked over at Noriko. &quot;What
    about you, Noriko? Anything you want to do?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    pursed her lips. Then she said, &quot;I've always wanted to be a
    teacher.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her
    reply caught Shuya by surprise since he'd never heard about it. He
    exclaimed, &quot;Really?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    turned to look at Shuya and nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    wanted to be a teacher in this lousy country?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    grimaced, &quot;There are good teachers too. I...&quot; she looked
    down and continued, &quot;I thought Mr. Hayashida was a good
    teacher.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    had been a while since Shuya recalled the corpse of Mr. Hayashida,
    whose head was half crushed. &quot;Dragonfly&quot; died for their
    sake.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You're
    right,&quot; Shuya agreed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    said, &quot;It might be difficult to become a teacher as an exile.
    But you might be able do research at some university. Ironically
    enough, the rest of the world seems very interested in this country.
    Then you&nbsp;might be able to teach.&quot; He continued staring
    ahead, then tossed his cigarette butt into the puddle by his feet. He
    put another cigarette in his mouth and lit it. He continued, &quot;So
    you should go for it, both of you. Be what you want to be. Follow
    your heart and give it your best shot.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought what he said was kind of cool. Follow your heart. Do your
    best. The way the late Shinji Mimura would also say something
    sometimes that hit the mark.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    he realized something.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What
    about you?&quot; He asked anxiously, &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I told you. It's payback time against
    this country. No, that's not it. They owe me, and they're going to
    pay me back. No matter what. I can't join you guys.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No!&quot;
    Noriko said with anguish.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    responded differently, though. He clenched his teeth and said, &quot;Let
    me join you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Shuya for a moment. Then he looked down and dismissively
    shook his head. &quot;Don't be stupid.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why
    not?&quot; Shuya said insistently. &quot;You're not the only one with
    a grudge against this fucking country.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    right,&quot; Noriko insisted. Her response surprised Shuya. Noriko
    looked at Shogo and continued, &quot;We'll do it together.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at them. He heaved a deep sigh. He looked up and said, &quot;Look.
    I think I told you before that this country might be fucked up, but
    it's well run. It's almost impossible to take it down. No, I'd say
    it's absolutely impossible right now, but I...&quot; He turned around
    and then looked beyond the roof at the sky turning white from the
    receding rain. Then he looked back at them. &quot;To use a cliche, I
    just want to take a stab at it. I'm getting back at them. I'm only
    doing it for my own sake, which isn't such a bad thing.&quot; He
    stopped and then said, &quot;No, it's not bad at all.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    then—&quot; Shuya said but Shogo interrupted him, raising his
    hand.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    not done.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    shut up and let him speak.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    saying you'll die if you join me. You just said you're going to be
    with Noriko. Which means...&quot; He looked at Noriko. Then he looked
    back at Shuya. &quot;You still have Noriko. You protect her, Shuya.
    If she's in danger then fight for her. Whether your assailant's a
    burglar, the fucking Republic of Greater East Asia, or an
    extraterrestrial alien.&quot; Then he turned to Noriko and said
    kindly, &quot;You too. You still have Shuya, right? Protect him,
    Noriko. It's foolish to die pointlessly.&quot; Then he looked at
    Shuya again. &quot;You understand? There's nothing left for me. So
    I'm just doing it for my sake. It's different for you guys.&quot; The
    last statement sounded adamant. He checked his watch, tossed another
    cigarette into the puddle, got up and went out from under the roof.
    The chirping bird call rang out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he listened Shuya recalled a song by a mainland Chinese rocker that
    went: &quot;Perhaps you are saying/You love me even though I have
    nothing at all.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    what did Shogo mean when he said he had nothing?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    tweaking the bird call for exactly fifteen seconds, Shogo went back
    underneath the roof and sat down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    asked Shogo, gently, &quot;Don't you have someone you care about?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had wanted to ask that too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    opened his eyes and then forced a grin. &quot;I wasn't planning on
    telling you, but...&quot; he said and then took a deep breath. He
    continued, &quot;No, maybe I did want to tell you.&quot; He reached
    behind for his back pocket and pulled out his wallet. He removed a
    photo with frayed edges.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    took it. She and Shuya looked at it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    photo included Shogo. He was wearing a school coat, and his hair was
    as long as Shuya's. He was smiling, wearing a bashful smile that was
    hard to imagine on him now. And on his left was a girl in a sailor
    suit uniform. Her black hair was bundled over her right shoulder. She
    looked assertive, but her smile was incredibly charming too. In the
    background were a road, gingko-like trees, a whiskey billboard ad,
    and a yellow car.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;She's
    beautiful,&quot; Noriko exclaimed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    rubbed the tip of his nose. &quot;Really? She's not what you'd call
    typically beautiful, but I always thought she was pretty.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    shook her head. &quot;Well, I think she's very pretty and
    very...mature looking. Is she the same age as you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    broke into a bashful grin that was reminiscent of the one he wore in
    the photo. &quot;Yeah. Thanks.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    gazed at the two smiling faces next to each other in the photo and
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hey,
    what do you mean you have nothing?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    But Shuya had overlooked something crucial.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    is she in Kobe?&quot; Shuya asked.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grimaced. He shook his head and said, &quot;Remember, Shuya? I played
    this fucking game once before. And I was the 'winner.'&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was when Shuya realized. And Noriko probably did too. Her face
    stiffened.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;She
    was in my class. I wasn't able to save Keiko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    fell silent. Shuya finally felt he could truly understand Shogo's
    anger, the sheer depth of it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you see now,&quot; Shogo said, &quot;I really have nothing. And it's
    payback time against this country for killing Keiko.&quot; Shogo put
    another cigarette in his mouth and lit it. Smoke drifted by.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    her name was Keiko,&quot; Shuya finally asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,&quot;
    Shogo gave several small nods.&quot;'</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Kei</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">'
    means 'joy.'&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized it was same kanji character as the first character to
    Yoshitoki's name.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Were
    you,&quot; Noriko gently asked, &quot;with her until the very end?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smoked silently. After a while he replied, &quot;That's a hard one to
    answer.&quot; He continued, &quot;Her last name was Onuki. The roll
    call started with No. 17 in that game. Whatever. Anyway, Keiko's
    number came before mine, so she left three numbers before me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko listened quietly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    thought she might be waiting for me somewhere near the departure
    point. She just might be. But she wasn't there. I mean it couldn't be
    helped. Just like with this current game. It was dangerous to hang
    around the departure point.&quot; He took a drag from his cigarette
    and exhaled. &quot;But I finally found her. The game took place on an
    island like this one, but I found her.&quot; He took another drag and
    exhaled. Then he continued, &quot;But she ran away.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was shocked. He looked at Shogo. His stubbly face remained calm. It
    seemed like he was doing his best to restrain his emotions.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    tried chasing her, but I was attacked by someone else. I managed to
    kill that person...but I ended up losing sight of her.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    took another drag and then exhaled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Keiko
    couldn't trust me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    still wore his poker face, but there was a tense look in his eyes.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    I still looked for her. The next time I found her she was dead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    understood. Once he was back here Shuya had told them about Yukie
    Utsumi's group and observed, &quot;It's so hard to...trust someone,&quot;
    to which Shogo responded by saying, &quot;Yes, it is. It's
    very...hard.&quot; Shuya now saw why Shogo looked so uneasy then. He
    also understood why Shogo said Hiroki might have found Kotohiki dead,
    or that she might not necessarily trust him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    asked me, Shuya,&quot; Shogo said. Shuya looked up. &quot;Why I
    trusted you guys, when we first met, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;
    Shuya nodded. &quot;I did.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And
    I believe I said you two made a nice couple,&quot; Shogo said and
    glanced up at the roof. By the time he lowered his eyes, the tension
    in his cheeks was gone. &quot;It's true. That's how you two looked.
    So I decided I wanted to help you guys out, unconditionally.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh
    huh.&quot; Shuya nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    a while Noriko said, &quot;I bet...&quot; Shuya looked over at
    Noriko. &quot;She was just terrified... and confused.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;No.&quot;
    Shogo shook his head. &quot;I-I really loved Keiko. But there must
    have something about the way I treated her when we were going out.
    That's what I think it came down to.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    so wrong,&quot; Shuya adamantly insisted.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked over at him, his arms folded over his pulled-up knees. The
    smoke from the cigarette in his hands drifted up gently like silk.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There
    was a misunderstanding. A small misunderstanding, I'm sure. Given how
    fucked up this game is. The odds were against you. That's what it
    really came down to, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grimaced wryly again and only replied, &quot;I don't know. I'll never
    know.&quot; Then he tossed his cigarette into the puddle and took out
    the bird call from his pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This...&quot;
    he said, &quot;Unlike most city kids, Keiko loved to go on mountain
    walks. The Sunday after the week that fucking game happened she&nbsp;was
    supposed to take me bird watching.&quot; He raised the bird call
    between his right thumb and index finger up to his eyes and examined
    it as if it were a jewel. &quot;She gave this to me.&quot; He smiled
    and looked at Shuya and Noriko. &quot;This is the only thing I have
    left of hers. It's my lucky charm. Didn't bring much luck, I guess.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he put it away, Noriko returned the photo. Shogo put it back in his
    wallet, which he tucked into his back pocket.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    said, &quot;Hey, Shogo.&quot; Shogo looked up at her. &quot;I don't
    know how Keiko felt at the time. But...&quot; She flicked her tongue
    against her lips to moisten them. &quot;But I think Keiko loved you
    in her own way. She had to. I mean, she looks so happy in that photo.
    Don't you think?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Of
    course, she did.&quot; Noriko nodded. &quot;And if I were Keiko, I
    would want you to live. I wouldn't want you to die for me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grinned and shook his head. &quot;Well, that's just a difference in
    opinion.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But,&quot;
    Noriko insisted, &quot;please take it into consideration. Okay,
    please?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    lips moved as if he were on the verge of saying something, but then
    he shrugged and smiled. Sadly.</font></font></p>

    said, &quot;Shogo.&quot; He looked at Noriko. &quot;I know I'm
    repeating myself, but I have to say it. If I were Keiko, this is what
    I'd say.&quot; She looked up at the sky, now tinged with orange, and
    continued, &quot;Please live. Talk, think, act. And sometimes listen
    to music...&quot; She stopped, then she continued, &quot;Look at
    paintings at times to be moved. Laugh a lot, and at times, cry. And
    if you find a wonderful girl, then you go for her and love her.&quot;</font></font></p>

    that's the Shogo that I really loved.&quot; Then she looked over at
    Shogo. She seemed slightly embarrassed, but added, &quot;That's what
    Keiko would have said.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    ash on Shogo's cigarette grew longer.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    said, &quot;Come on, Shogo. Aren't there ways to tear up this country
    without dying? It might be a roundabout way but still...&quot; He
    continued, &quot;I mean we got to be such good friends. We'd really
    miss you. Let's go to America, the three of us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    fell silent. Then realizing his cigarette was burnt down to the
    filter, he tossed it away. He looked up at them. He was on the verge
    of saying something.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>come

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    quickly lifted his left arm with his right hand and checked his
    watch. The muddy display read 6 p.m., exactly, five seconds past the
    hour.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Can
    you hear me? Well, I guess there aren't too many of you left who can
    hear. Now then, I will announce the dead. Now in the boy's group...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was already thinking. There were only four boys left, Shuya, Shogo,
    Hiroki, and Kazuo Kiriyama. (Of course the same was true with the
    girls, Noriko, Kayoko Kotohiki, Mitsuko Souma, and Mizuho Inada.)
    Kazuo couldn't die so easily. And Hiroki had sent the signal. So none
    of the boys were dead.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    can't be—&quot; Shuya uttered. Ever since the smoke signal went up,
    there hadn't been any gunfire. Or was Hiroki stabbed? Or... did he
    not hear Sakamochi's announcement correctly? Were his ears playing
    tricks on him?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No.
    Sakamochi continued, &quot;All right then. Now there are four
    students remaining. Can you hear me, Kiriyama, Kawada, Nanahara, and
    Nakagawa? Wonderful work. I'm really proud of you all. Now then, I'll
    announce the new forbidden zones.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before
    Shuya could mark his map, Shogo said, &quot;Gather your stuff.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh?&quot;
    Shuya asked, but Shogo only signaled for him to hurry up. Sakamochi
    continued, &quot;From 7 p.m...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Get
    up. It's Kazuo. It's likely he somehow found out about Hiroki's
    method to contact us. We might have been sending our signal to Kazuo
    all this time.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    immediately got up. Noriko was carrying her day pack on her
    shoulders. Then right before or after Sakamochi finished his
    announcement saying, &quot;All right then, do your best. Just a
    little more to go—&quot; Shuya saw Shogo's eyes glance at that
    alarm system consisting of notches cut into thin trees wrapped with
    thin wire.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    then he saw this wire fall off the rain-drenched tree trunk.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Duck!&quot;
    Shogo yelled. The rattling burst through. Right above Shuya and
    Noriko's heads, the rock wall burst into sparks. Its shards rained
    down on them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Crouched,
    Shogo held the Uzi and shot into the shrubs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Maybe
    he was hit or maybe he wasn't, Kazuo (who else could it be now?)
    didn't return fire. Shogo said, &quot;This way! Hurry!&quot; They ran
    south along the rock wall away from Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    they reached the area beyond the rock wall where Shogo had been using
    the bird call, they heard a gun rattle off again. It missed them.
    They entered the bushes ahead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a crevice in the rock waist deep, less than a meter wide. Covered
    with dirt and leaves, it continued southward. Shuya didn't know about
    its existence, but Shogo probably chose their position with this
    place in mind. It was a naturally formed trench. Shogo urged them on.
    Shuya and Noriko jumped down. Shogo rattled off his Uzi and followed
    them. A different rattling followed from behind. A thin tree with
    roots along the edge of the crevice exploded with a pop right by
    Shuya's head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Run!&quot;
    Shogo shouted, and they ran down the crevice. Shuya almost tripped
    over a dry branch lying on the ground, but he managed to regain his
    footing and followed after Noriko. Behind them, the two guns
    exchanged shots.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly
    Noriko stopped as if she were hit by something. She moaned and
    crouched over. Shuya, who was turned towards Shogo, quickly ran to
    Noriko. Did she trip over something?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No.
    She looked up at Shuya. A cut ran under her left eye and blood gushed
    down her cheek. Maybe her right hand was cut too then. It was also
    bloody. The Browning that had been in her hand was on the ground by
    her feet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    put his right hand on her shoulder, looked up, and found...a thin,
    twisted wire stretched out across the crevice, neck-high. It didn't
    matter where Kazuo had found it (he'd probably unfastened the wire
    used to secure some object). Kazuo had already anticipated their
    escape by this route. At Shuya's height the wire would have cut right
    into his neck. At least this didn't happen to Noriko—but she could
    have lost her sight.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was furious. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I
    don't know what Kazuo's about. Shogo had said, &quot;He just chooses
    as he goes.&quot; I don't know if he's abnormal or normal, or a kind
    of genius or madman, but hurting Noriko, that was just unforgivable.
    I'm going to kill that motherfucker!</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    tucked his CZ75 in front to help Noriko up, picked up the Browning,
    and then held Noriko's shoulder with the gun in his hand. Noriko
    staggered but managed to get up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    caught up as he fired away. He glanced back at the two of them and
    then—maybe he caught a glance of the wire—clenched his teeth. As
    he turned around again, Shuya saw beyond him Kazuo Kiriyama in his
    school coat jump into the crevice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    yelled, &quot;Duck!&quot; as he fired away. Holding his machine gun,
    Kazuo quickly ducked behind a curve in the crevice. Shogo's shots
    tore at the rock along the curve. Dust flew up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Run!&quot;
    Shogo repeated. Shuya held Noriko up and proceeded to run under the
    wire. He slowed down though, in case of any more wire traps.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was frustrated. If he could only use both of his arms he could pummel
    Kazuo with bullets while he held Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    fired away as he stuck close to them from behind. Kazuo also returned
    gunfire as he approached them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    crevice that continued for fifty or sixty meters came to an end.
    Shuya leaped up to the ground before Noriko. He took Noriko's
    uninjured left hand and pulled her up. Noriko bravely stiffened her
    face to conceal her pain, but the left half of her face was now
    covered with blood.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    stop!&quot; Shogo yelled over the gunfire. Shuya pulled Noriko's hand
    and dashed into the bushes ahead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    they came out of the bushes, they found themselves in the front yard
    of a residential house built against the side of the mountain. It was
    an old single-story building. There was a white light truck right
    next to an entrance road in front of the house. For some reason there
    was a washer and refrigerator, both on their sides, loaded in the
    light truck. Were they being dumped?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Get
    behind the truck!&quot; Shogo's shouted again. Shuya and Noriko
    stepped onto the rain-drenched soil. Holding each others hands, they
    made their way behind the truck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    the time Shogo followed and slid in, Shuya had Noriko sit down, the
    Browning in his hand. He caught a glimpse of a figure moving in the
    shrubs. He shot several times at it. He felt a searing pain through
    his left shoulder, from the bullet lodged inside it. The pain
    sizzled, but he had to ignore it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    reloaded a magazine into his Uzi and handed it over to Shuya. He
    said, &quot;Shoot away. Hold him back.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    put his Browning down by his feet, took the Uzi, and fired away at
    the area where Kazuo appeared again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    didn't shoot back. As Shuya peeked above the pickup truck rack,
    Noriko planted herself right next to him. In her hands was the
    Browning he had put down.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you all right, Noriko?&quot; he asked as he checked for Kazuo's
    movements in the shrubs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    okay,&quot; Noriko replied.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    glanced beyond Noriko over at Shogo. Shogo opened the door, dove into
    the driver's seat, and started working on something.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    the sudden revving sound, the truck Shuya and Noriko were leaning
    against began to vibrate. The revving became a low hum as the water
    drops on the truck body began trickling with the soft vibration.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    poked his head out. &quot;Come on! We're getting out of here! Noriko,
    hurry!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    offered her his hand and helped her into the truck. &quot;Shuya! The
    front passenger's seat!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    shouted as he started backing up the truck. He steered the wheel,
    backed the truck towards Kazuo, and then turned it around. The
    passenger's seat door was there for Shuya. Noriko opened the door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rattling exploded as Shuya reached out his right hand to get in. This
    time though, it was accompanied by a hammering sound. A hole formed
    in front in the trucks narrow cabin ceiling and the exiting bullet
    tore through the windshield from inside right in front of Shogo.
    Shuya leaned against the truck—he knew where Kazuo was now—pointed
    the Uzi upward and fired away. The shadow slipped away into the
    bushes surrounding the houses up in the side of the mountain. Kazuo
    had made his way up there.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without
    a second to lose, Shuya leaped into the passenger's seat. Shogo
    pulled the car out. The truck slid out onto the unpaved entrance
    road. The machine gun rattled, shredding the hose of the washer on
    the rack. It thrashed in the air like a snake, fell off the car, and
    vanished behind them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    gunfire ceased.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you all right, Noriko?&quot; Shuya asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    tilted her face, covered in red, and nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot; But her
    body was still tense. She still held onto the Browning. Shuya put the
    Uzi in his right hand between his thighs, pulled out a bandanna from
    his pocket, and wiped her face. Blood came pouring out of the wound,
    and her pink flesh showed underneath. A simple operation wasn't
    enough to remove the scar from this wound. To do this to a girl...</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn
    it,&quot; Shuya looked over at Shogo, who steered the wheel. &quot;He
    already knew where we were a while ago. That's how he knew about our
    escape route.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    Shogo shook his head, saying, &quot;No.&quot; As he quickly shifted
    gears to weave his way through the winding road, he said, &quot;He
    couldn't have known for sure. He only figured it out at the very end.
    Otherwise, he would have shown up before Sakamochi's announcement. We
    would have come out welcoming him, thinking it was Hiroki, and then
    he would have easily finished us off. He didn't know&nbsp;where we
    were, so during the breaks between the bird calls he planted that
    wire to bide his time. He probably planted that wire in other spots
    too.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then thought, I see. That might have been true. To bide his time. But
    that was what ended up severely injuring Noriko. He said, &quot;Noriko,
    show me your right hand.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    then finally let go of her gun (its grip was also covered in blood)
    and gave Shuya her hand. It seemed small and frail, but there was a
    sharp tear running down between her middle and ring finger. The palm
    of her hand was covered with a web of blood in the pattern of the
    textured pistol grip. He surmised, the wire must have cut her face
    first and then as she fell, it must have torn through her hand she
    put forward as she fell. The wound might have been much more severe
    if the gun hadn't been in her hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    wanted to wrap his bandanna about Noriko's palm, but realized he
    couldn't use his left hand.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    said, &quot;I'm okay. I'll do it.&quot; She took the bandanna from
    Shuya, flapped it, and spread it out, and then wrapped it around her
    right hand. She folded the edges and tied it up.&nbsp;Then she held
    the Browning again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Beyond
    the bullet-ridden front windshield the view suddenly opened up. The
    truck was descending the mountain. Under the sunset, the flat field
    widened between the mountainous woods.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized something urgent and said, &quot;Shogo. We're heading into a
    forbidden zone—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't
    worry. I know what I'm doing.&quot; Shogo answered as he looked
    ahead. &quot;Did you hear? The forbidden zones are B-9 after 7 p.m.,
    E-10 after 9 p.m., and F-4 after 11 p.m. Add those to the map.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    remembered too. He pulled out the worn out map from his pocket,
    spread it out on his thighs, and marked off the areas while the truck
    shook.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    truck descended and passed by houses. It entered a road equally wide,
    but paved this time. The southern mountain was visible beyond the row
    of fields. On the right was a low hill. On the left approximately two
    hundred meters away was a residential house (it seemed to be in a
    forbidden zone). There were two more ahead slightly to its left. And
    then beyond were scattered houses leading up to the residential area
    on the island's eastern shore. In front of that region there was the
    field, now hidden in the shade of the low hill, where they first
    encountered Kazuo . One more hill over was the school, which was also
    hidden from view.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    slowed the truck down and continued forward. And now the wide
    longitudinal road crossing the island was right there in front of
    them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    passed through the fields and came onto the road. Shogo turned the
    wheel and turned it again. He stopped the truck in the middle of the
    road, its engine idling. Shogo then lunged at the cracked front
    windshield with his fist and knocked the entire window out onto the
    front of the truck. The glass made a shattering sound.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Check
    the map,&quot; Shogo said, his hand back on the steering wheel. Shuya
    picked up the map again. &quot;According to my memory we should still
    be able to take this road all the way east. Am I right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    checked the map with Noriko. &quot;Yeah, that's right. But F-4 ahead
    is going to be shut off at 11 p.m.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    won't matter,&quot; Shogo said, his eyes glaring ahead. The black,
    rain-drenched asphalt stretched out in a straight line. &quot;So this
    road should be okay right up to the eastern residential area?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    we're fine up to the front of the curve.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded in response.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    poked his head out of the window again and looked back. &quot;What
    about Kazuo?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked at Shuya. &quot;He'll be coming. How could he not? Take a
    close—&quot; he said when an old, worn out, light-olive minivan
    suddenly appeared after turning the curve of the mountain road they'd
    just descended. Shuya immediately realized it was the vehicle parked
    by the house they had just passed by.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    adjusted the rearview mirror, looked at it, and said, &quot;See?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    quickly closed in on them, and the moment Shuya confirmed Kazuo was
    sitting in the driver's seat, a burst of shots came exploding out.
    Shuya tucked his head back in. The bullets hit the truck with a
    clanging sound. Shogo shifted gears, and the truck moved out onto the
    wide road, heading east.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    Shuya leaned out of the window looking back, Kazuo's minivan also got
    on the same road. Shuya fired his Uzi. Following Kazuo's reflexes,
    the minivan smoothly moved to the right and dodged the shots.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Aim
    good, Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By
    then Kazuo's minivan had sped up and caught up to them.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo!
    Can't you drive faster!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Calm
    down,&quot; Shogo said and steered the wheel slowly from left to
    right—probably so Kazuo couldn't aim at the tires. Kazuo began
    shooting again, and Shuya tucked his head in. It seemed Kazuo had
    also smashed his windshield so he could have better control of his
    gun. Shuya leaned out again and fired away at Kazuo's torso. Kazuo
    steered away and dodged the gunfire. He hardly ducked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    row of shells popping out of the ejection port suddenly stopped, and
    the Uzi trigger mechanism made a locking sound. Shuya realized he was
    out of bullets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    leaned over Noriko and gave him another magazine. Before Shuya could
    take it, Kazuo's minivan suddenly came up to them. Shuya pulled out
    his CZ75 and fired away. Undeterred, Kazuo came at them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn,&quot;
    Shogo said. His profile broke into a slight grin. &quot;You're dead
    wrong if you think you can beat me driving.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    suddenly made a sharp turn. He simultaneously pulled on the side
    brake with his left hand. Shuya was thrust to his side. The truck
    spun around the entire road like a car in a chase scene.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While
    the truck spun around, Kazuo's minivan came racing at them. The
    familiar rattling sound burst at them from the driver's seat. The
    rearview mirror shattered above Noriko's head.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Duck!&quot;
    Shogo yelled. But Shuya was busy firing away at Kazuo with his CZ75.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a miracle Kazuo's machine gun bullets missed Shuya. But Shuya's
    shots also ended up missing Kazuo too. As the truck's front bumper
    skimmed by the minivan's left frontside, Shuya got a close up view of
    the eternally frigid eyes of Kazuo Kiriyama.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    tires screeched against the wet surface. The spinning finally halted.
    By the time it stopped, the hunter and the hunted were reversed.
    Shogo had managed to dodge the front of Kazuo's minivan, completing a
    full spin. Kazuo's minivan was in front. Shogo immediately
    accelerated forward. The engine whirred away with a sudden surge of
    power, and the pickup lunged forward towards the back of the minivan.
    Kazuo&nbsp;was turning around.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Fire
    away, Shuya! Everything you got!&quot; Shogo yelled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    didn't have to be told. Shuya squeezed the trigger of his reloaded
    Uzi with all his might and fired away with the gun on full auto. He
    knew the scorching, empty shells were bursting out at Noriko, but he
    couldn't be concerned about that. The minivan's rear windshield burst
    apart. Along with a popping sound, the rear hatch opened up. Then the
    right tire was blown out with a popping sound. Shuya was out of
    bullets, but the minivan was now tottering over to the edge of the
    road.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stepped on the gas. He pulled up to the left side of the minivan,
    swerved the wheel, and smashed the right side of the truck against
    the minivan.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    blow was hard on them, but it was nothing compared to the damage it
    did to Kazuo's minivan. At first, it lost control, then it slid to
    the right side of the road, and flew over its edge. The next moment
    it landed into the lower field and nosedived to the ground. Cabbage
    leaves flew up into the air.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    it was still.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stopped the car parallel to the minivan and stepped on the emergency
    brake. He looked over its roof.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Give
    me the gun, Shuya,&quot; Shogo said. Shuya gave him the Uzi. Shogo
    changed the magazine, extended his arm out of the window, pointed the
    gun at the minivan, and pulled the trigger. Shogo's hand shook
    vertically. Even from the front passenger's seat Shuya could tell the
    minivan was getting pummeled with bullets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    reloaded another magazine and fired away. He inserted another
    magazine and emptied that one as well. Meanwhile, Noriko was
    inserting spare bullets into the emptied out magazine with her
    wounded hand. After she was done, Shogo took that too and fired away.
    Noriko loaded more magazines. Slightly bent over, Shuya looked at
    Noriko's hands, then at Shogo's, and finally at the minivan.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    went through this round once, then twice. Because the Uzi was a 9mm
    weapon, they ended up using the bullets from the same caliber CZ75
    and Noriko's Browning too.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    Uzi trigger device indicated the magazine was empty with a locking
    sound. It was out of bullets. Blue smoke drifted up from the short
    muzzled Uzi. The narrow cabin was filled with the odor of gunsmoke.
    How many bullets had Shogo fired? The Uzi Shuya had taken from
    Yukie's group came with five extra magazines and plenty of spare
    bullets, but if they were to include the bullets from the CZ75 and
    the Browning wouldn't the number go up to two hundred and fifty? Or
    three hundred?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    its left-side front passenger's seat and roof facing them, the
    minivan was honeycombed. It looked more like a strange beehive in the
    shape of a car.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    sky was orange now. Shuya couldn't bother to look at it, but judging
    from the light, he assumed there was a nice sunset in the western
    sky.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Did
    you get him?&quot; Shuya asked. Shogo was about to reply when—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    minivan proceeded to move. It was backing up. It cut across the edge
    of the field and backed up to the shoulder of the road. Once again,
    towards the back of their truck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was speechless. Not only was the van's engine still functioning,
    Kazuo was still alive and operating the vehicle. Shogo had wagered
    everything by emptying their entire bullet supply and yet...Kazuo
    was&nbsp;still alive!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Beyond
    the bullet-ridden vehicle, Kazuo's upper body sprung up like a
    jack-in-the-box. With a machine gun. With the rattling sound, the
    small window above Noriko's head shattered. Two holes were punctured
    into the steel board next to it. The truck was a domestic model made
    of flimsy steel, so Shuya was surprised it had actually remained
    unscathed this long. This also might have been thanks to the washer
    and refrigerator lying on the rack. Or maybe, Shogo had loaded them,
    anticipating this situation.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn
    it!&quot; Shogo shifted gears and moved the car out. &quot;Shoot,
    Shuya! Back me up!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    fired his CZ75 at Kazuo's minivan. Kazuo fired back, the bullets
    landing right next to Shuya's face as sparks flew from the steel
    frame of the truck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    immediately emptied his gun. He changed the magazine and fired. Then
    he realized, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>once
    I shoot this round, I'm out of bullets. We'll only have Noriko's
    Browning and her extra magazine. That's it.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While
    he hesitated, Kazuo fired. He heard the rattle. A zinging sound. More
    sparks this time from the refrigerator on the rack. The small door on
    the freezer swung open and fell out.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo!
    I'm out of bullets!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    calmly steered the wheel. &quot;His machine gun will be useless too.
    He doesn't have time to reload it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just
    as Shogo said, single shots came at them now. BLAM, POP. The seat by
    Noriko's shoulder exploded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko!
    Get down!&quot; Shuya yelled, stuck his arm out of the window,
    pointed at Kazuo, who now held a gun in one hand, and fired. He was
    out of bullets. He took the Browning from Noriko's hand. He fired
    again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To
    the left of the pickup, between the houses and the field, was a
    warehouse burnt to the ground. That must have been what Shogo had
    been referring to, the building that went up in flames in the late
    night explosion. Now they had less than two hundred meters before
    hitting the curve that led to the residential area on the eastern
    side of the island.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Hey,
    Shogo, that's—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    replied, &quot;I know,&quot; and swerved the wheel to the left. The
    left side of the truck under Shuya's body floated up. But once it
    regained its balance, the truck leaped onto the unpaved road. It was
    another road twisting through the fields, heading back up to the
    northern mountain. Kazuo followed after them in the minivan.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    aimed and fired. Kazuo ducked and fired away. This time the steel
    board right next to Shogo's head was punctured.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya!
    Just keep on shooting until you're out! Don't let him shoot!&quot;
    Shogo yelled, hunched over the wheel. Shuya noticed the left shoulder
    of his school coat was torn and bleeding. He'd been hit by Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was about to protest, but he leaned out of the window and fired.
    Shogo might plan on escaping into the mountain again. If so, then the
    thing was to make sure Kazuo couldn't shoot. Or by some stroke of
    luck, maybe I'll end up hitting him—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    fired.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    now the Browning was emptied out, the breechblock held open. He was
    out of bullets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were approaching the mountain. A familiar sight. Strangely enough,
    there was a farmhouse surrounded by a concrete wall. And a field. A
    tractor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    realized this was where they first fought against Kazuo. But now they
    were on the opposite side.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,
    I'm out of bullets! Are we escaping into the mountain!?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    could make out Shogo's profile breaking into a slight grin. He
    replied, &quot;Oh, we still got bullets.&quot; Shuya knit his brows,
    puzzled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    truck ran off the entrance road that led to the farmhouse and dashed
    onto the ridge road. He passed by the side of the tractor. The road
    ahead became too narrow for the truck.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    didn't seem to care and drove the truck straight ahead. Kazuo came
    after them, maintaining the same distance behind—only twenty
    meters. He fired from the driver's seat.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    truck dove into the farm and stopped. The side of the front
    passenger's seat where Shuya sat now faced Kazuo. Shogo kicked open
    the door and yelled, &quot;Get out, this way!&quot; He jumped out of
    the car.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nudged Noriko, crouched down and followed them. He glanced back.
    Kazuo's minivan was coming right at them!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was a blast.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    left front tire of Kazuo's minivan was blown off. It was only ten
    meters in front of them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    minivan tottered, then slid along the ridge of the elevated field on
    the left, and its front went up in the air like a surfboard taking on
    a large wave. The next moment it rolled over on its roof into the
    field.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Right
    before or after the minivan came to a complete halt, a black shadow
    leaped out. By the time it somersaulted and came to a kneeling
    position, Shuya could see it was Kazuo. Sparks flew out from his
    hands with a continuous popping noise. Then there was another blast.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    was still inside the truck as he saw it through the window of the
    passenger's seat: the sight of Kazuo Kiriyama's body being blown back
    like an arrow.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Kazuo
    landed on the field with a thud. He was completely still.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    suddenly recalled the way Kyoichi Motobuchi had died. His
    sausage-factory trash-bin stomach. Kazuo was too far away to check
    the condition of his stomach. Still, given how he was pummeled with
    shotgun pellets, there was no way he could have been alive.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Shuya finally emerged from the truck. He saw Shogo holding that
    shotgun—the one Shuya had tossed into the field when he was running
    away from Kazuo—as he rose from behind the truck rack.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    we still got bullets.&quot; Shogo had picked up the shotgun Shuya
    tossed away yesterday, loaded the shotgun cartridges he still had (he
    must have only been able to load two shots in that span of time), and
    fired away...and shot down Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Right
    at the beginning,&quot; Shogo said slowly, &quot;he missed us with
    his surprise attack. So he lost. Because then he had to take on all
    three of us.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    took a deep breath, put down the shotgun—which thumped against the
    refrigerator on the truck rack—and took out a pack of Wild Sevens
    from his pocket. He took one out and lit it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You're
    bleeding, Shogo,&quot; Noriko said, pointing at his left shoulder.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;
    Shogo glanced at his wound and then grinned. &quot;It's nothing.&quot;
    He exhaled.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Bang.
    Shogo's body bent over. The Wild Seven cigarette fell from his mouth,
    leaving a trace of smoke in the air. The stubbly face contorted. His
    eyes gazed down at Shuya's feet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    saw Kazuo's raised torso on the lower field, holding a gun in his
    right hand. He was still alive! But his stomach had been pummeled by
    the shotgun blast!</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    body slowly caved in. Kazuo quickly pointed his gun at Shuya. Shuya
    realized that he was, along with Shogo, no longer behind the truck.
    He had no gun in his hand. No, he had no bullets. It was too late for
    him to reload the shotgun on the truck rack. It was way too late.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    small muzzle of Kazuo's gun a good ten meters away looked like a
    giant tunnel. A black hole engulfing everything.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Bang.
    Shuya instantly closed his eyes. He felt a piercing sensation run
    through his chest and thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>oh,
    man, I'm dying.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    opened his eyes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    wasn't dead.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was Kazuo in the diagonal orange light of the setting sun, a red dot
    punctured by his nose. The gun fell from his hand. He immediately
    fell back and crashed onto the ground.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    slowly turned his head to his left. Noriko was standing, holding the
    Smith &amp; Wesson .38 caliber revolver with both of her hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wow.
    So that's what it was. While Shogo loaded the shotgun, Noriko had
    also loaded the revolver Shuya had tossed aside yesterday with her
    remaining .38 Special bullets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko's
    hands were trembling with the gun.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Huh.&quot;
    Shogo stood up before Shuya could even help him up. Shuya nervously
    asked, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    didn't respond. He picked up the shotgun, and as he loaded it with
    the cartridges in his pocket, he walked toward Kazuo. Exactly two
    meters in front of him, he pointed the gun at Kazuo's head and pulled
    the trigger. Kazuo's head flinched only once.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    turned on his heels and came back.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Are
    you all right?&quot; Shuya asked him again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    I'm fine.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    walked over to Noriko, gently held her hands, still holding the Smith
    &amp; Wesson, and lowered them. He quietly said, &quot;He's dead. I'm
    the one who killed him, not you.&quot; Then he looked over at Kazuo.
    &quot;So he was wearing a vest,&quot; he said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    then finally understood. Kazuo Kiriyama had been wearing a
    bulletproof vest.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Noriko asked, her voice slightly trembling. &quot;Are you really all
    right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled kindly and nodded. &quot;I'm all right. Thanks, Noriko.&quot;
    Then he took out his pack of cigarettes again. It seemed empty so he
    looked around and picked up the lit cigarette which had fallen from
    his mouth, and slowly raised it to his lips.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    turned around and stared out at the sun setting over the island. It
    was over. At least this wonderful game was. And now, including Kazuo
    Kiriyama over there, thirty-nine of their dead classmates were lying
    sprawled all over the island.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    had that dizzy spell again. Maybe his thoughts were numbed by this
    hollow feeling. What the hell was this all about?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Faces
    flashed by one by one. Yoshitoki Kuninobu's face as he shouted, &quot;I'll
    kill you!&quot; Shinji Mimura's face grinning slightly as Shuya left.
    Tatsumichi Oki's face as he swung the axe with bloodshot eyes. Hiroki
    Sugimura who vanished into the dark outside the medical clinic,
    saying, &quot;I have to see Kayoko Kotohiki,&quot; Hirono Shimizu as
    she ran away from Shuya after shooting down Kaori Minami. The tearful
    Yukie Utsumi saying, &quot;I just wouldn't know what to do if you
    died.&quot; Yuko Sakaki, who pried Shuya's fingers loose. Then the
    cold eyes of Kazuo Kiriyama, who'd cornered them until now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    were all gone. Not just everyone's lives, but so many other things
    were destroyed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    it wasn't over yet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Shuya said. Shogo looked up, shortened cigarette in hand. &quot;We
    should treat you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled. &quot;I'm all right. It's nothing. Take care of Noriko's
    wounds.&quot; Then he said, &quot;I'm going to collect Kazuo's
    weapons.&quot; He walked over to the overturned minivan.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    led the way up the mountain. The weapons he picked out of Kazuo's
    assortment were tossed into the day pack on his shoulders. He didn't
    offer them to Noriko or Shuya. It wasn't necessary for the time
    being.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    followed Shogo as he held Noriko up on his left side. They had
    cleaned Noriko's cheek wound with water for now and covered it with a
    row of four band-aids. Shogo said they were better off not stitching
    it. Shuya cleaned her hand wound and wrapped it again with the
    bandanna. Shogo had also quickly taken care of his wounds.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was already getting dim in the mountains, but there was no need to
    make their way through bushes, so it was relatively easy to climb.
    The ground strewn with piles of leaf mold was damp from an entire
    afternoon of rain.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    had covered quite a distance ever since Shogo announced, &quot;We're
    climbing the mountain,&quot; and proceeded forward.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo,&quot;
    Shuya called. Shogo turned around. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grinned. &quot;We have just a little more to go. Just follow me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    readjusted his arm on Noriko and followed him.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    peak with the viewing platform where Yukiko Kitano and Yumiko Kusaka
    were killed and its southern side had become a forbidden zone a long
    time ago. Shogo stopped right before they entered that area, in the
    upper mid-region of the mountain. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Come
    to think of it</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Shuya thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>a
    little ways below I saw Hirono Shimizu shoot Kaori Minami.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    should do it,&quot; Shogo said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    slope and woods ended here, and the area offered a good view. They
    could see the entire island, now immersed in dim blue after sunset,
    where the fierce battle between the classmates of Third Year Class B
    Shiroiwa Junior High School took place. However, the school holding
    their final enemy, Sakamochi, was hidden by hills.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath. Then he asked, &quot;What's up here anyway? How
    are we going to escape?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    smiled without looking at Shuya. Then he said, &quot;Relax. Take a
    look over there.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko looked over where Shogo was pointing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was over the southern mountain. Although it was growing dim, they
    could still make out the ocean, several islands, and beyond, the
    mainland. Shuya could make out a mist of lights scattered over the
    mainland. If they were closer, they could have discerned which ones
    were neon lights and which ones were lights along the shore highway.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now
    Shuya also knew that this was Okishima Island in the Takamatsu-shi
    Bay. There were two others islands, Megijima and Ogijima, forming a
    vertical row of islands, where Okishima was the one at the far
    northern tip. Which meant that the small island beyond the southern
    mountain was Megijima, and beyond that was Ogijima, and beyond that
    was the mainland—Kagawa Prefecture of Shikoku.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    said, &quot;It's not very familiar to me, but that's your home over
    there. Shiroiwa-cho must be over there. You won't see it again, so
    have a good look.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Did

    </p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked back at Shogo. &quot;Don't tell me we came all the way up here
    for this.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    snickered. &quot;Hey, what's the rush?&quot; Then he said, &quot;Show
    me your gun. There's something I need to check.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    handed over her Smith &amp; Wesson to Shogo. He opened up its
    cylinder and checked it. Shuya thought Noriko had reloaded it after
    taking that single shot at Kazuo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    didn't return the gun and instead held it in his right hand. He took
    a deep breath and said, &quot;Do you remember how I kept on saying I
    might be doing this just to have a group, and that my intention might
    be to kill you off in the end?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    raised his brow. &quot;Yes, you said that, but?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So,&quot;

    can enjoy the view a little more. I told you, it'd be the last time.&quot;

    he'd never shown before.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    crow cawed. Was it flying up above in the darkening evening sky?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    finally spoke. His feelings were out of sync with the situation, he

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You

    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    stuttered, &quot;Come on, stop it. Th-then you were just acting until

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    replied calmly, &quot;You're the ones who helped me. I probably
    couldn't have killed Kazuo without your help.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then...so
    that story about Keiko was a lie too!?&quot; His words trembled. The
    more he tried to keep his voice down the louder it became.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yep,&quot;
    Shogo answered curtly. &quot;It was true I participated in the Hyogo
    Prefecture Program last year, and it's true there was a girl named
    Keiko Onuki. But there was nothing between us. The girl in that
    photo's my girlfriend, but her name's Kyoka Shimazaki, a totally
    different person. She's still in Kobe. She's out of her mind. Well,
    anyway, she insisted I hold onto this photo. I got to say she was a
    good lay, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    took a deep breath. A light early summer breeze blew against his
    skin, but for some reason it felt chilly. Then he cautiously asked,
    &quot;But what about that bird call?...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    had another curt response. &quot;I just happened to find that at the
    general supply store. I figured it'd be useful. And it proved to be,
    in the end.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    Kawada (Male Student No. 5) reclined against the soft sofa on the
    ship. He was swaying slightly from the rough waves.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    room was fairly spacious for a small patrol ship. The ceiling itself
    was low, but the room must have been a couple square meters. There
    was a low table in the middle, and two sofas on each side, with Shogo
    sitting on the one away from the door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because
    the room was below deck it had no windows, so he couldn't see
    anything outside, but it must have been past 8:30 p.m. by now. The
    yellow ceiling lights shined against the glass ashtray. Shogo didn't
    have any more cigarettes to smoke, though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    the forbidden zones were all deactivated after the game was over,
    Shogo obeyed Sakamochi's announcements and made his way to the
    school. In front of the school were the bodies of Yoshio Akamatsu and
    Mayumi Tendo, and inside the classroom, the bodies of Yoshitoki
    Kuninobu and Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, all left untouched.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    silver collar was finally detached, and after the shooting for the
    news segment, he was taken away by soldiers and escorted to the
    harbor. There were two ships docked there. One for the winner...and
    the other a transport ship to return the soldiers packed inside the
    school. Most of the soldiers boarded this ship. Only the trio who
    were in the classroom during Sakamochi's game instructions joined
    Sakamochi to board Shogo's ship. And tomorrow the subcontracted
    clean-up crew would take care of the remaining bodies of the students
    on the island. The speakers and school computers at the school
    building would also be dismantled in a matter of days. Of course the
    software and data for the game had already been removed from the
    computer. This was the identical procedure taken immediately after
    the Kobe Second District Junior High School Program came to an end
    ten months ago.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And
    now Shogo was waiting here. They were now south of Okishima. The
    patrol ship was returning directly to Takamatsu Harbor, but the
    soldiers' transport ship would probably alter its course and head
    west towards the military base.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    doorknob rotated with a click. The soldier who stood guard—the
    uncharismatic one called &quot;Nomura&quot;—by the door looked in,
    then moved away. Kinpatsu Sakamochi appeared. He came in with a tray
    with two teacups and asked, &quot;Did I keep you waiting, Shogo?&quot;
    as he entered the room. Nomura closed the door.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    walked up to him with his short legs. He put the tray on the table
    and said, &quot;Here. It's tea. Drink all you want.&quot; He took out
    a flat, letter-sized envelope from under his left armpit and sat on
    the sofa facing Shogo. He tossed the envelope onto his side of the
    table, then combed back his shoulder-length hair behind his ear.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    glanced down at the envelope indifferently and began speaking while
    staring at Sakamochi. &quot;What do you want? I wish you'd leave me
    alone. I'm tired.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;There
    you go.&quot; Sakamochi brought the cup to his mouth with a grimace.
    &quot;You should be more polite&nbsp;with adults. I had this student
    Kato once. He used to give me a hard time, but now that he's grown
    up, he's quite respectable.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    not one of your pigs.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    opened his eyes as if taken aback and then smiled again. &quot;Come,
    come, Shogo. I wanted to have a nice chat with you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    slouched against the sofa and folded his legs. He remained quiet as
    he rested his cheeks in his hands.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Where
    should I begin?&quot; Sakamochi put his cup down and rubbed his open
    hands together. His eyes glimmered. &quot;Did you know we have a
    betting pool for the Program, Shogo?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    squinted his eyes as if looking at filth. Then he said, &quot;I
    wouldn't be surprised. You guys are tasteless.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    smiled. &quot;I had my money on Kazuo. Twenty thousand yen. With my
    salary, that's a lot. But thanks to you, I lost.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Too
    bad,&quot; Shogo said in a tone devoid of sympathy.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    smiled again. Then he said, &quot;I explained how I could tell where
    everyone was with those collars, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    answer was obvious. Shogo didn't respond.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    stared at Shogo. &quot;You were with Shuya and Noriko throughout the
    game, right? Then you betrayed them in the end. That's what it came
    down to, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    wrong with that?&quot; Shogo replied. &quot;There are no restrictions
    in this wonderful game. Don't make me laugh. You can't criticize me
    for that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
    broad grin spread over Sakamochi's face. He combed back his hair,
    took a sip of tea, and rubbed his hands. He spoke as if he were
    sharing a secret, &quot;Hey, Shogo. I'm not really supposed to be
    sharing this with anyone, but I'll tell you the truth. These collars
    have built-in mics, so we could hear everything the students said
    during the game. I bet you probably didn't know that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo,
    who seemed so indifferent in his responses, finally seemed
    interested. He knit his brows and pursed his lips. &quot;How the
    fuck...would I know about that?&quot; he said. &quot;So then you
    heard everything, how I tricked them.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh
    huh, that's right.&quot; Sakamochi nodded. &quot;But that wasn't very
    nice, Shogo. Was it. 'Even if we managed to capture Sakamochi, I'm
    sure as far as the government's concerned he's expendable'? You said
    that. Being a Program Instructor is a pretty respectable occupation.
    Not everyone can do it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ignoring
    Sakamochi's complaint, Shogo asked, &quot;Why are you telling me
    this?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Oh,
    I don't know,&quot; Sakamochi replied. &quot;With your wonderful
    performance I couldn't resist telling you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;This
    is bullshit.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked away, but Sakamochi pressed more insistently, &quot;A
    wonderful performance, but...&quot; Shogo looked back at him.
    Sakamochi continued, &quot;There's something I don't get.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;What's
    that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why
    didn't you shoot those two right after Kazuo was killed? You could
    have, right? That's the one thing I just don't get.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Just
    as I told them,&quot; Shogo, replied without hesitating, &quot;I just
    thought I'd let them have one last look at their home. A little gift
    for them before their descent into hell. You may not believe this,
    but I can be pretty loyal. I mean, thanks to them, I won.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    continued smiling and uttered, &quot;Hmmm.&quot; Then he raised his
    cup to his mouth. He sat back on the back of the sofa with the cup in
    his hand and spoke again, &quot;Hey, Shogo, I got hold of the data on
    the Kobe Second District Junior High School Program.&quot; Then he
    stared at Shogo. Shogo stared back at him and remained silent. &quot;And
    as far as I can tell from the data, nothing indicates you had any
    special relationship with Keiko Onuki.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Onuki?
    Like I said I made that up,&quot; Shogo interrupted him, but
    Sakamochi spoke over him and continued, &quot;As—&quot; Shogo shut
    up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;As
    you said, to Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, you saw Onuki
    twice—the first time only for a moment and then the second time
    right before you won, when she was already dead. Even according to
    the taped conversations, you never even once uttered her name. Not
    once. Do you remember that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;How
    could I? It's like I said—there was nothing between me and her. You
    heard me, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But
    the thing is, Shogo, the second time around you stopped there for two
    hours.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    was just a coincidence. It was a good spot to hide and rest. That's
    how I was able to remember that name so vividly. I tell you, she died
    a horrible death.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    grin still glued across his face, Sakamochi nodded, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hm
    hm</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    &quot;The other thing is...the entire eighteen hours which transpired
    in this game—which is actually quite fast, maybe the designated
    area was too small—in any case, you didn't exchange a single word
    with anyone. I mean, aside from saying things like, 'Stop' or 'I'm
    not an enemy.' &quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    was just an act too,&quot; Shogo interrupted him. &quot;It's so
    obvious.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    smiled, ignoring Shogo's statement. &quot;So I have no idea how you
    approached this game. You moved around a lot but—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It
    was my first time. I didn't know how to play it smart.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    then nodded, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hm
    hm</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
    He held back a grin as if concealing his amusement. He sipped his tea
    and returned the cup to the table. Then he looked up and said, &quot;By
    the way, about that photo? I'd like to look at it, if you don't
    mind.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Photo?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on, you showed it to Nanahara and Nakagawa, right? You said it was a
    photo of Onuki. Let me see it. It was actually a photo of someone
    named Shimazaki, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    twisted his mouth. &quot;Why should I show it to you?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Come
    on, just show it to me. I'm your instructor. Please. Come on,
    please,&quot; Sakamochi said and bowed over the table.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    reluctantly reached around and searched his back pocket. He raised
    his brow and swung his hand back. It was empty.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    gone,&quot; he said. &quot;I must've dropped it somewhere when we
    fought Kazuo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Dropped
    it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Uh
    huh. It's true. I dropped my wallet. Well, I don't need it anyway.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    Sakamochi burst out laughing. As he laughed he said, &quot;I get it.&quot;
    He held his stomach, slapped his thighs, and kept on laughing.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked perplexed but then he squinted his eyes. He looked up at the
    ceiling in the windowless room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Despite
    the insulation of the patrol ship's walls, he could hear the faint
    but definite whirring sound. It was definitely not the sound of the
    ship's engine.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    sound became louder and louder and then after a certain point, it
    receded. Then it was almost entirely gone.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    grimaced.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Does
    that trouble you, Shogo?&quot; He stopped laughing. He still had that
    creepy smile on his face, though. &quot;That was a helicopter.&quot;
    He reached out for his tea again and emptied his cup. He put the
    empty cup on the table. &quot;It's heading toward the island where
    you all fought.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    knit his brows, but this time his reaction seemed to have a different
    connotation. But Sakamochi didn't care. He arrogantly leaned back on
    the sofa and changed the subject, &quot;Hey, Shogo. Let's talk about
    those collars again. Well, you know, they're actually called
    'Guadalcanal No. 22.' That doesn't matter. Anyway, weren't you
    telling Shuya about how they couldn't be dismantled?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Seeing
    how Shogo didn't respond, Sakamochi continued, &quot;In fact, your
    theory was right on the mark. Each unit is equipped with three
    different systems, so even if one of them has a one percent margin of
    error, with three systems, only one in a million can break down. In
    reality, the chances are even slimmer. So, it's just like you said.
    No one can escape from them. Any attempt to remove it will ignite it,
    killing its wearer. It's very rare someone actually tries that,
    though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    still remained silent.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    thing is,&quot; Sakamochi then leaned over, &quot;I just thought I'd
    get in touch with the Defense Forces weapons lab this time around.
    And guess what?&quot; He looked at Shogo. &quot;They said it could be
    deactivated by anyone with a basic knowledge in electronics, using
    basic transistor parts, the kind you find in a radio. Of course,
    that's assuming you already know the circuitry inside the device.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stayed quiet, but as Sakamochi's continued staring at him, he
    suddenly said in a strange, blank tone of voice as if the thought
    suddenly occurred to him, &quot;I don't get it. Who could possibly
    have that information?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    grinned and nodded. He continued, &quot;Yes. Well, anyway, if we were
    to assume the collar was disabled, then obviously it would transmit a
    signal informing us of the wearer's death, right? In other words, if
    there was a student who could remove that collar, then he could
    survive without a hitch. He'd just have to wait out the game, and
    once the military leaves the premises he could take his time
    escaping. That's right, just like you said to Shuya Nanahara. Say the
    game were to end in the afternoon, then the&nbsp;subcontracted
    clean-up crew comes the following day. So there's plenty of time in
    between. Also, this time of year the water isn't too cold to swim
    in.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    gave Shogo an imploring look, but Shogo only responded with a &quot;Huh.&quot;
    Sakamochi leaned back on the sofa. &quot;This is absurd. The collar
    circuits are supposed to be top secret, right? How could a junior
    high school kid possibly know about it?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    replied, &quot;He could, though.&quot; Shogo looked back at
    Sakamochi. &quot;See, all of this information, including your
    records, and the Guadalcanal device, under normal circumstances I
    wouldn't have looked up any of this stuff. I would have just sat
    back, impressed by your intelligence. This time though, I was
    contacted by Dictator Headquarters and the Special Defense Forces
    before the game began. I mean, on the twentieth.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stared at Sakamochi.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    continued, &quot;They said someone hacked into the government's
    central operations system in March.&quot; He paused. Then he added,
    &quot;Of course, the hacker thought he managed to leave without a
    trace. He was incredibly skilled, and although he encountered the
    administrator while he was hacking, he managed to erase his log-in
    access before escaping. But...&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    paused again. Shogo kept quiet.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;...the
    government system has tight security. It has a another secret log-in
    system that records every operation. Of course, they usually don't
    monitor this system, and the administrator didn't think there was
    anything abnormal at the time. That's why they took so long to
    discover it. But they found it. Yes, they did.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    sealed his lips and stared at Sakamochi. But his Adam's apple moved
    ever so slightly. The movement was hardly discernible.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Look,&quot;
    Shogo said. &quot;A subcontractor really did tell me about rounding
    up the corpses. I was having a few drinks at this bar with him. The
    topic just came up. And the instructor from our last game told us the
    Program hardly ever ends from just time running out. You can even ask
    him.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    rubbed his right hand under his nose and stared at Shogo. &quot;Why
    are you telling me this? I didn't even ask you about that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    Adam's apple moved again. This time it definitely moved.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    then snickered and continued, &quot;So apparently some of the hacked
    data included information on the Program. In other words, technical
    specifications on the Guadalcanal collar. Why would someone take such
    useless information? I mean, what's the point? Even if the hacker
    were to publicize it, the government would only design a new collar,
    and that would be the end of that. There's no sign of that for now.
    But maybe we can assume this much: the intruder was driven to access
    this information at all cost. Don't you think?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    didn't respond. Sakamochi sighed and picked up the envelope he'd
    tossed out. He flipped it over with one hand and pulled out the
    contents. He placed them side by side in front of Shogo.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    were two photos. They were both black and white and printed on B5
    paper. One of them had no contrast at all, so it was hard to tell
    what it was, but the other one clearly showed a truck and three black
    dots scattered around it. Given how it was the top of a truck, the
    three dots were obviously heads.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    see, right?&quot; Sakamochi said. &quot;That's the three of you just
    a while ago. Right after you killed Kazuo. Those were taken by
    satellite. We don't usually do this kind of thing. But I want you to
    take a closer at this other photo. See? You can't really make out
    anything, right? But that's actually a photo of the mountain. It was
    taken when you shot those two. There wasn't enough light, and it's
    obscure because you're all hidden by the woods. You can't see it.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    fell silent. The ship swayed a little, but Shogo and Sakamochi stared
    at each other, completely still.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Sakamochi took a deep breath and once again combed back his hair
    behind his ear. He broke into a smile and spoke in a strangely
    intimate voice, &quot;Say, Shogo. I've been keeping track of this
    game from the very beginning. Right? After you shot Shuya Nanahara
    and Noriko Nakagawa, Nanahara took fifty-four seconds to die, while
    Nakagawa ended up taking one minute and thirty seconds to die. They
    should have died instantly if you shot them point blank. So what's
    this time lag about?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    was silent, but—whether he was aware of it or not—his cheeks
    stiffened. He managed to speak out, &quot;It can happen. I'd have
    thought they died immediately but—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Enough.&quot;
    Sakamochi cut him off. He said in an adamant voice, &quot;Let's put
    an end to this.&quot; He looked into Shogo's eyes and nodded as if
    admonishing him. Then he said, &quot;Shuya Nanahara and Noriko
    Nakagawa are still on that island. They're still alive, right?
    They're hiding in the mountain. You're the one who hacked into the
    government central system. Or one of your friends. You knew how to
    dismantle that collar. You knew we could monitor your conversations,
    so you gave us that radio drama performance of shooting those two.
    Then you removed their collars. Am I right? I didn't say it was a
    wonderful performance. You're still in the middle of that wonderful
    performance.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    gazed at Sakamochi. He grimaced through clenched teeth.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    kept on smiling and continued, &quot;Didn't you give them some
    messages about meeting spots? And you were supposed to hook up
    together later, right? Well, you can forget about that. That
    helicopter that just flew by is going to spray the island with poison
    gas. It's a composite poison mustard gas developed recently called
    Greater East Asia Victory No. 2. The guard ships are still over
    there. Nanahara and Nakagawa are finished.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he stared at Sakamochi, Shogo dug his fingers into the synthetic
    leather elbow rest. Sakamochi took another deep breath and sank back
    into the sofa. He combed back his hair. &quot;We have no precedent
    for this. Strictly speaking, you're not really the winner. But one of
    the education committee officials I work for bet a lot of money on
    you. So I decided to treat this internally. It'll help my career if I
    help him out, therefore, you'll be the official winner. According to
    the records, you'll be the killer of those two. Are you satisfied
    now, Shogo?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    was utterly stiff, as if he might start shaking any second now. But
    as Sakamochi raised his brow, Shogo looked away from him and stared
    down at the floor. &quot;I-I don't know what you're talking about...&quot;
    he said. He nervously opened and then clenched his fist several
    times. He glanced back at Sakamochi and then anxiously said, &quot;Why
    bother spraying gas? You're just wasting tax money.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    snickered. &quot;We'll soon see whether I am.&quot; Then he said,
    &quot;Oh, that's right.&quot; He pulled out a small automatic pistol
    from under his coat and pointed it at Shogo. Shogo opened his eyes
    wide. &quot;I've decided to take care of you as an internal matter
    too. You have dangerous ideas. I think it's against this country's
    interests if we let someone like you live. Have to toss the rotten
    apple out of the box. The sooner the better. You arrive DOA due to
    injuries from the game. How's that? Oh, don't you worry. If you
    happen to have friends too, we'll hunt them down. We won't have to
    interrogate you.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    slowly tore his eyes away from the gun and looked at Sakamochi.
    &quot;You...&quot; he said. He was now baring his teeth. Sakamochi
    broke into a grin. &quot;Bastard!&quot; Shogo howled in a voice full
    of indignation,&nbsp;despair, probably mixed in with a dose of fear
    towards everything incomprehensible. What he wanted to do most was
    grab Sakamochi by the neck. But the gun restrained him. He could only
    clench his fists over his thighs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;D-don't
    you have any kids? How can you accept this fucked up game?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Of
    course I have kids,&quot; Sakamochi replied casually. &quot;You know,
    I like to have a good time, so we're about to have our third.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    didn't respond to the joke, yelling instead, &quot;Then how can you
    accept this? One of your kids might end up in this game in the
    future! Or is it that kids of high-ranked officials like you are
    exempted?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Offended,
    Sakamochi shook his head. &quot;That's preposterous. How can you say
    that, Kawada? You read the Program Requirements, right? There are no
    exceptions. Of course I've done some sneaky things. Using connections
    to get my kid into a prestigious school. I'm human. But being human
    also means we have to abide by certain rules...oh, that's right, you
    weren't able to steal that, huh?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    top secret agenda also had information on the Program. I'll tell you
    now, this country needs the Program. The thing is, it's not an
    experiment at all. Come on, why do you think we have the local news
    broadcast the image of the winner? Of course, viewers might feel
    sorry for him or her, thinking, the poor student probably didn't even
    want to play the game, but had no choice but to fight the others. In
    other words, everyone ends up concluding, you cant trust anyone,
    right? Which would extinguish any hope of uniting and forming a coup
    d'etat against the government, hm? And so the Republic of Greater
    East Asia and its ideals will live on for eternity. Naturally
    everyone has to die equally for the sake of this noble goal. I've
    passed this wisdom onto my kids. My oldest kid is in the second grade
    now and she's always saying how she'll sacrifice her life for the
    Republic.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    cheeks began to tremble. &quot;You're insane,&quot; he said, &quot;You're
    out of your mind! How can you be like that?&quot; He was nearly
    sobbing, &quot;A government is supposed to serve the needs of the
    people. We shouldn't be slaves to our own system. If you think this
    country makes sense, then you're insane!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    let him finish. Then he said, &quot;Hey, Kawada. You're still a kid.
    It looks like you guys had some talks, but I want you to think a
    little more. This is a marvelous country. It's the most prosperous
    country in the world. Well, you might not be able to travel abroad
    much, but its industrial exports are unsurpassed. The government's
    slogan is telling the truth when it claims our per capita production
    is the best in the world. The thing is though, this prosperity only
    comes as a result of unifying the population with a powerful
    government at the center. A certain degree of control is always
    necessary. Otherwise...we'll decline into a third-rate country, like
    the American Empire. You know, right? That country is in turmoil from
    all kinds of problems like drugs, violence, and homosexuality.
    They're living off their past glory, but it'll only be a matter of
    time before they fall apart.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    remained silent. He clenched his teeth. Then he spoke quietly, &quot;Let
    me say one thing.&quot; Sakamochi raised his brow. &quot;What? Go
    ahead.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    guys might call it prosperity, but...&quot; Shogo's voice sounded
    tired, but still dignified, &quot;...it'll always be phony. That
    truth won't change even if you kill me now. You're doomed to be
    phony. Don't forget that.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Are you done with your speech?&quot; He
    pointed his gun at him. Shogo tightened his mouth and glared at
    Sakamochi, ignoring the gun. He seemed ready to face the
    consequences.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Later,
    Kawada.&quot; Sakamochi nodded as if to bid him farewell. Then his
    finger began pulling the trigger when—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	BRRRATTA
    the tapping, typewriter-like sound pierced through the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi's
    finger stopped for a moment. He glanced at the door for a split
    second—long enough to be distracted. By the time he looked back
    Shogo was right in front of his face. Even though there was a table
    in between them, he was only ten centimeters away. He'd moved
    instantly, like a magician, as if he'd teleported.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rattling sound continued outside the room.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    left hand held down the gun in Sakamochi's right hand. Sakamochi
    froze up and looked up at Shogo's face, now within kissing distance.
    His long hair wasn't too messy. He didn't try to swing his hand loose
    from Shogo. He merely looked at Shogo with his mouth closed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rattling sound again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    door opened. &quot;An attack—&quot; Nomura stopped once he grasped
    the situation and attempted to lift his rifle.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still
    holding Sakamochi's right hand down with his left hand, Shogo spun
    Sakamochi's body around as if dancing a tango. As he turned, he
    squeezed Sakamochi's index finger on the trigger and began firing
    away. Three shots pierced Nomura right above his heart. He groaned
    and collapsed. The rattling sounded louder now, with the door open.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked into Sakamochi's eyes again. Their bodies still entwined, he
    drove his right fist under Sakamochi's chin.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sakamochi
    coughed out blood. His eyes stared up at Shogo. The blood spilled
    from his lips, dripping down to his chin and onto the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    told you, it was a waste of tax money.&quot; Shogo twisted his fist
    further into Sakamochi's chin. Sakamochi's eyes rolled away from
    Shogo. Then they slowly rolled upwards.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    moved away from Sakamochi, and Sakamochi crashed onto the sofa. His
    throat was now exposed. A brown stick poked out of his windpipe like
    a strange ornament. Closer up, the gold logo, &quot;HB,&quot; on its
    butt-end was visible. This was one of those pencils that everyone,
    including Shogo and Shuya, had written, &quot;We will kill each
    other,&quot; but Kinpatsu Sakamochi probably had no idea.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    glancing down at Sakamochi he tucked the gun into his belt. He dashed
    over to Nomura, who was lying face up, and picked up his rifle. He
    took the extra magazines from his belt and left the room. He opened
    the two doors down the corridor on the right, but there were only
    rows of bunk beds. No one was inside.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    rattling was approaching him. A soldier came tumbling down the stairs
    beyond the narrow corridor. It was the soldier Kondo, now dead. He
    had a gun in his hand but wasn't wearing and body armor—maybe he'd
    thought he was safe now that the game was over.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    stepped around Kondo's body, entered the staircase, and looked up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was Shuya Nanahara (Male Student No. 15) holding an Ingram M10,
    standing next to Noriko Nakagawa (Female Student No. 15). They both
    looked down at him. They were soaking wet.</font></font></p>

    that Shogo was safe, Shuya cried in relief. Upon hearing the gunfire
    besides his shots, he thought they might have been too late.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    ran upstairs' with a rifle he'd taken from one of the soldiers.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;So
    you're all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;
    Shogo nodded. &quot;Sakamochi's dead. Did you get rid of everyone?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    got everyone on deck. But we couldn't find that one called Nomura—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Then
    that's everyone. I got rid of Nomura,&quot; he said. He passed by
    them and ran to the bridge where the pilothouse was located.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
    was one body lying in the corridor leading to the pilothouse, then
    two more inside and outside the briefing room under the pilothouse.
    One of them was the soldier Tahara, the others were the ship's naval
    crew, but Tahara was the only with a gun, and it was only a pistol.
    Shuya had blown them away with the Ingram. There were two others
    lying on deck, the first naval soldiers Shuya killed.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After
    glancing at Tahara's body, Shogo grabbed the railing that led up to
    the pilothouse and said, &quot;You were merciless, Shuya.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah.&quot;
    Shuya nodded. &quot;I was.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once
    he was up in the pilothouse, there were two more of Shuya's victims,
    crew members sprawled in the corner. In the dark window were several
    holes formed either from stray bullets or shots that had torn through
    the crew members.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    ship passed an island lit up with residential lights, probably
    Megijima. Shuya wondered whether the gunfire could be heard over
    there or even further into the sea around them. Well, it wasn't that
    uncommon to hear sudden gunfire in this country, so he wasn't too
    worried.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    looked straight ahead. Shuya and Noriko looked in the same direction
    and saw what looked like a gravel carrier approaching them on their
    right. Shogo held the steering wheel and shifted the bar next to it
    methodically.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I
    hope you didn't catch a cold,&quot; Shogo asked.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    fine.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;And
    you, Noriko?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm
    okay too.&quot; Noriko nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    squinted ahead as he said, &quot;I'm sorry. I did the easy work this
    time.&quot; The gravel carrier was approaching.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That's
    not true,&quot; Shuya responded as his eyes shuttled between Shogo's
    hands and the ship ahead of them. &quot;I wasn't in any condition to
    take on Sakamochi. He was armed. You were the right man.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he kept watch, the carrier loomed larger and larger. But...they
    managed to skim past each other. The&nbsp;carrier's lights receded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Phew.&quot;
    Shogo took a deep breath and then let go of the steering wheel. He
    began pressing the intricate rows of buttons on the nautical
    instruments. He gazed at the panel for a while, and after seeing one
    of the diodes go out, he took the radio transmitter. A voice came
    through the speaker, &quot;This is the Bisan Seto Inland Sea Traffic
    Advisory Service Center.&quot; That's what it sounded like.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;DM
    245-3568, we cannot confirm. Are you having trouble?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Our
    GPS navigation device seems to be broken. We will stop the boat for
    an hour or so to repair the device. Could you notify the other
    ships?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yes.
    We need your present location.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    read off the display on the nautical instrument. Then he ended the
    transmission.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was only buying time to move the ship somewhere. Shogo steered the
    wheel now and made a sharp left turn. Shuya felt the ship rock from
    the wide turn.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he cautiously handled the wheel Shogo said, &quot;That bastard
    Sakamochi realized what was going on. I'm glad I had you guys get on
    board.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. Water dripped down from his bangs.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was right. After Shogo had shot his gun twice into the air, he
    pressed his fingers against his mouth, signaling Shuya and Noriko,
    who were both blinking, to stay quiet. He took his map out of his
    pocket and scribbled on the backside. The note was obscured in the
    dim light, but they managed to read it. Then Shogo removed their
    collars. All he used was a wire attached to a transistor—which he
    had for some reason—a knife, and small screwdriver. And then Shogo
    took out a simple ladder made of bamboo and rope from his day pack.
    He scribbled more on the map, &quot;Sneak into the ship they put me
    on. It'll be nighttime, so you'll be fine. Make your way to the
    harbor by beach. There'll be a chain tied to the anchor. Tie the rope
    ladder to it and hold on. Once the anchor comes up, and the ship
    starts moving, climb up to the deck and hide behind the life
    preservers on the ship's stern. Then attack when the time's right.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of
    course it was no easy feat holding onto this flimsy rope ladder as
    the ship sped up, stirred up waves, and dragged them through the sea.
    It was also hard to reach the deck less than half a meter above the
    top of the ladder. Without his left arm, Shuya just couldn't do what
    should have been an easy task. But Noriko managed to lift herself up
    there despite her wounded hand, then offered a hand to Shuya.
    Noriko's strength took Shuya by surprise. In any case, they managed
    to do it.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;But...&quot;
    Shuya said, &quot;I wish you'd told us about this earlier.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    returned the wheel to the right and coyly shrugged his shoulders.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It
    would have made our actions less natural. Sorry, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    let go of the wheel. The black sea spread out in front of them. For
    the time being, there was no sign of any ship approaching. Shogo then
    began checking several of the ship's meters.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;It's
    amazing,&quot; Noriko said. &quot;You managed to hack into the
    government computer system.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    really,&quot; Shuya agreed. &quot;You were lying about being computer
    illiterate.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	His
    gaze still fixed ahead, Shogo grinned. &quot;Well, they found out
    anyway. Luckily, it all ended up working out.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    seemed satisfied with the meter readings and moved away. He walked up
    to one of the soldiers on the floor. Wondering what he was doing,
    Shuya and Noriko looked on as Shogo went through his pockets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Damn,&quot;
    he said, &quot;So even the Defense Forces aren't smoking now.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    was looking for cigarettes.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    did manage to extract a crumpled pack of Buster from the other
    soldier's breast pocket. The pack was covered in blood, but he
    casually pulled out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, and lit it up.
    He leaned against the side of the helm, and as he squinted his eyes,
    he exhaled contentedly.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    she watched him Noriko said, &quot;If our group was too large we
    wouldn't have been able to escape like this.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    nodded. &quot;That's true. And it had to be at night. But there's no
    point in going over that. We're alive. Isn't that enough?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Why
    don't you two go take a shower,&quot; Shogo said, &quot;It's in front
    of the stairs. It's tiny, but it should have hot water. You can just
    steal the soldiers' clothes.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded and put the Ingram down onto the low desk by the wall. He
    clutched Noriko's shoulder. &quot;Come on, Noriko. You go first.
    Wouldn't want you to get sick again.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    nodded. They were about to head towards the stairs when Shogo stopped
    them. &quot;Shuya,&quot; he said, &quot;wait, hold on.&quot; He
    rubbed out his cigarette against the bottom of the helm. &quot;First
    I'll show you how to steer this ship.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    raised his brow. He figured that Shogo would take care of guiding the
    ship. Come to think of it, Shogo probably wanted to take a shower
    too. Shuya and Noriko would have to steer the ship then.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    nodded again and returned to the helm with Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    took another deep breath and lightly tapped on the wheel. &quot;I'm
    steering the ship manually right now. It's less confusing than having
    it on auto-pilot. Now this,&quot; Shogo indicated the lever by the
    helm. &quot;It's like an accelerator and brake. Tilting it forward
    increases the speed and backwards slows it down. Simple, huh? And
    over here—&quot; Shogo pointed at the round meter installed right
    above the wheel. The thin needle was tilted leftward. It was
    surrounded with numbers and letters indicating directions. &quot;This
    is a gyro compass. It gives our direction. You see that ocean map?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    indicated the route they were taking to weave their way through the
    islands and reach the mainland Honshu from their current position
    east of Megijima Island. They would be best off, he said, landing on
    some hidden beach in Okayama Prefecture. Then he provided simple
    instructions for the radar and depth gauge.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    touched his chin. &quot;That's about it for your crash course. That's
    enough to steer this thing. Now, you always steer right of an
    oncoming ship. And the other thing is that you can't stop
    immediately. As you approach the shore you have to slow down well in
    advance. Got that?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    raised his brow again. He wondered, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>why
    is he advising me about docking too?</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    He continued to nod, though.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    added, &quot;The notes I gave you guys. Do you still have them? It
    actually has your contact information.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Yeah,
    we have them. But...you're coming with us, right? Right?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo
    didn't respond immediately to Shuya's question. He took out one of
    the cigarettes he'd stuffed inside his pocket, put it in his mouth,
    and lit his lighter. It lit up...but right then Shuya noticed
    something strange. Shogo's hand holding the lighter was trembling.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    seemed to have noticed too. Her eyes were wide open.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;You
    guys asked me...&quot; Shogo said over Shuya's words, his cigarette
    dangling from his mouth. His trembling hand tossed the lighter by the
    helm. He continued, &quot;...to come with you to the U.S.&quot; He
    removed the cigarette from his mouth with his shaking hand and
    exhaled. &quot;I thought it over. But...&quot; He stopped and put his
    cigarette in his mouth. He removed it, then he blew out smoke. &quot;It
    looks like I won't need to answer that anymore.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly,
    Shogo's body slid down. His head slumped forward as he fell on his
    knees.</font></font></p>

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Emptied
    of strength, Shogo's body felt heavy. That was when Shuya finally
    realized how Shogo's back was soaked. There was a tiny hole right
    below his neck. It was Kazuo's shot. The one Kazuo fired at him.
    Shogo claimed it was nothing. Why...why didn't he treat it
    immediately!? Or did he know it was fatal? Or did he delay it so
    Shuya and Noriko could get aboard?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In
    their arms, Shogo's body slowly gave way, and he slumped down on his

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;I'm

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Don't

    in the corner of the room, he lay down on his side.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Please.&quot;
    Shuya knelt down and touched Shogo's shoulder. &quot;Please get up.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo.&quot;
    Noriko was crying.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Noriko!&quot;
    Shuya scolded her. Noriko looked over at Shuya. &quot;Don't cry!
    Shogo can't die!&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shuya.
    Don't get angry with her over nothing,&quot; Shogo kindly admonished
    him, &quot;You have to be kind to your girl.&quot; Then he added.
    &quot;Besides, sorry, but I'm going.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's

    <p class="western" >

    now realized Shogo was dying. No, he had already known, but now he

    something to say. He knew what it was.</font></font></p>

    closed his eyes. He seemed to be grinning again. Then he said,

    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo!&quot;

    also put his hand on Shogo's thick hand. A thought occurred to him.

    the bustling crowd at the Umeda-Osaka train terminal, each pedestrian
    busy for whatever reason, Shuya Nanahara (Male Student No. 15, Third
    Year Class B, Shiroiwa Junior High School) heard the announcement,
    &quot;We have this report on the recent murder of a Program
    Instructor in Kagawa Prefecture,&quot; as he was stepping off one of
    the pair of escalators that ran along the station's wide stairways.
    He gently squeezed Noriko Nakagawa's (Female Student No. 15, same
    school) shoulder with his right hand and stopped.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On
    the giant TV screen as high as the escalator, there was a large,
    closeup image of a reporter in his fifties, his hair parted in a 7:3
    ratio.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    and Noriko walked up to the screen together. It was Monday, past 6
    p.m., so there were students and salarymen in business suits waiting
    around the area. Shuya and Noriko were no longer wearing their school
    uniforms. Shuya wore a pair of jeans, a print shirt, and a denim
    jacket. Noriko also wore jeans along with a dark-green polo shirt and
    a light-gray windbreaker on top. (They did however keep their
    sneakers, washing them after the game before they wore them again.)
    Shuya's neck was bandaged, but it was hidden by the jacket collar,
    and Noriko's left cheek was covered with a large bandage, but it was
    obscured by her black leather baseball cap that she kept pulled low
    over her eyes. She still dragged her right leg, but it wasn't so
    conspicuous anymore. Since his left arm was still paralyzed, Shuya
    shifted the bag strap against his left shoulder with his right hand.</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shogo's
    notes indicated the name of a doctor and his address in the city of
    Kobe. A small clinic in the back streets of the city, probably
    similar to the one Shogo's father ran. The doctor who still seemed to
    be in his twenties warmly welcomed them and treated their wounds.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo's
    father was a senior of my dad's in medical school. I owe a lot to
    that man too, though,&quot; the doctor said. He seemed to be
    well-connected, and the following day, that is, yesterday, he
    arranged their escape from the country. &quot;Shogo had me hold onto
    some money just in case of an emergency. We'll use that.&quot; They
    would first take a fishing boat from a small fishing village in
    Wakayama Prefecture into the Pacific Ocean, and then transfer to
    another boat in the Democratic Nation of the Korean Peninsula. &quot;You
    won't have any problems getting from Korea to America. It'll be the
    transfer from that first boat that's going to be hard.&quot; The
    doctor voiced his concern, but Shuya and Noriko really had no other
    choice.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    called home before they left the doctor's house today. She first
    called a close friend from another class, having her relay a message
    to her family to call the doctor's house from a payphone. It was a
    precaution against wiretapping. Shuya left Noriko alone for a while,
    but he could hear Noriko's sobbing from the hall where the phone was.
    Shuya himself didn't contact the Charity House. He thanked Ms. Anno
    and bade her goodbye in his heart. He did the same with Kazumi
    Shintani.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    reporter continued, &quot;Due to the Defense Forces helicopter's
    dispersal of poison gas over Kagawa Prefecture's Okishima Island,
    where this Program was held, the inspection of the site was delayed.
    However two days after the incident, the inspection was finally held
    this afternoon. We now know two students are missing.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    image changed. A zoom-lens camera from sea captured police officials
    and soldiers inspecting the island where Shuya and the others had
    fought for their lives. There were piles of corpses. For a split
    second, Shuya managed to make out two bodies. There were Yukie Utsumi
    and Yoshitoki Kuninobu, on the edge of a black pile of school coats
    and sailor suits, facing the camera. Despite the dispersal of poison
    gas, their faces managed to stay unharmed because they had died
    indoors. Shuya clenched his right fist.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;The
    missing students are Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, third-year
    students of Shiroiwa Junior High School in Kagawa Prefecture.&quot;
    The screen now displayed large closeup photos side by side.&nbsp;They
    were the same photos used for their student I.D. cards. Shuya shifted
    his eyes, but no one in the crowd staring at the screen seemed to
    notice them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    image of an empty coast right beside a mountain appeared. As the
    camera zoomed in, a small military-colored patrol ship which had run
    ashore appeared, and was now being examined by police officials and
    soldiers on the beach. This segment was shot immediately after the
    incident became known, so it was less recent.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;On
    the early morning of the twenty-fourth, the Kagawa Prefecture Program
    Instructor Sakamochi's patrol ship was found on the shores of
    Ushimado-cho in Okayama Prefecture. Instructor Sakamochi and nine
    Special Defense Forces soldiers, including Private Tokihiko Tahara
    were discovered along with the Program's winner, Shogo Kawada.&quot;
    Sakamochi's closeup photo appeared. He had long hair. &quot;Suspecting
    there was a conflict, the police and Defense Forces officials
    proceeded to investigate. Authorities now believe the two missing
    students from today's report may provide the crucial link to the
    incident. They are currently searching—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    reporter continued, but Shuya was too preoccupied with the following
    to listen.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a short clip subtitled, &quot;Winner Shogo Kawada— Found Dead.&quot;
    Under normal circumstances, they would have only shown a generic
    subtitle, &quot;Male Student Winner,&quot; and the short segment
    would have only been broadcast on the Kagawa Prefecture local news.
    Shuya and Noriko watched the news at the Kobe doctor's house several
    times, but they only showed Shogo's photo. This was the first time
    they saw this clip.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Held
    between the soldiers, Shogo stared into the camera. Then—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At
    the end of the clip, which lasted approximately ten seconds, he
    grinned and raised his right fist with his thumb pointing up.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
    crowd staring at the screen sounded dismayed. They probably thought
    Shogo was proud about his victory.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But
    of course that wasn't it at all</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
    Shuya thought as he watched the screen return to the image of the
    reporter.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Was
    it a message to him and Noriko? Did he already know he was going to
    die when he stood in front of the government camera? Or was it just a
    display of his unique sense of irony?</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I'll
    never know.</i></font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
    Just as Shogo once said.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then
    Shuya and Noriko's closeup photos were displayed again.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Any
    sightings should be reported to—&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Let's
    go Noriko. We have to hurry,&quot; Shuya whispered. He took her left
    hand with his right hand. They turned away from the screen and began
    walking.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Shogo
    told me,&quot; Noriko said as they walked, holding hands, &quot;before
    you came back...when you were with Yukie's group, he told me
    something.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    tilted his head and looked at Noriko.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    looked up at Shuya. Her eyes covered by the brim of her hat were
    moist. &quot;He said he was glad to have such good friends.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    looked up and nodded. He just nodded.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    let a group of six or seven students pass by, and then they started
    walking again. Shuya said, &quot;Noriko. We'll always be together. I
    promised Shogo.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    seemed to be nodding.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;For
    now we escape. But some day I'm going to tear this country down. I'm
    still keeping the promise I made to Shogo. I want to tear it down for
    Shogo, for you, for Yoshitoki, for everyone. Will you help me when
    the time comes?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    squeezed Shuya's hand and replied assertively, &quot;Of course, I
    will.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They
    departed from the crowd. They stood in front of a ticket dispenser.
    Noriko looked up at the display above the ticket machine, took out
    some change, and counted it out. Then she stood in line in front of
    the ticket machine to buy their tickets.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    stood still, waiting for Noriko's turn to come. It came immediately.
    She put the coins into the coin slot.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    casually looked over to his left.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    squinted his eyes. There was the entrance to the station concourse,
    and he could make out the Osaka high-rise district, just beyond the
    road where taxis and cars were passing each other. A tall, uniformed
    man emerged from this background, heading straight towards them. He
    skillfully dodged the flow of pedestrians and made his way toward
    Shuya.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    was a policeman's uniform. There was a gold peach insignia shining at
    the center of his cap.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With
    his right hand Shuya slowly reached for the Beretta M92F tucked in
    the back of his jeans as he looked for an escape route. There was a
    road at the entrance opposite the policeman. If they could get there,
    they could grab a cab—</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shuya
    whispered to Noriko, who returned with their tickets, &quot;Forget
    about the train, Noriko.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Noriko
    understood. She quickly turned and opened her eyes wide after seeing
    the policeman.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;That
    way,&quot; Shuya said. The policeman came running at them.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;We
    have to run, Noriko! Run as fast as you can!&quot; he said. As they
    dashed out, Shuya thought, </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hey,
    doesn't that sound familiar.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He
    glanced behind him. The police officer held out his gun. Shuya pulled
    out his Beretta. The officer shot immediately. BANG BANG. Two
    sweeping shots, but luckily no one in the crowd, including Shuya and
    Noriko, was hit. There were cries though, as some fell to the ground
    for cover, while others—having no idea where the gunfire came
    from—scattered in random directions. The officer, his gun down, ran
    toward them again, but then crashed into a fat woman carrying
    groceries, and clumsily fell. The woman fell too, and her bag of
    vegetables for dinner tumbled and slid on the floor.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That
    was all Shuya saw. He was looking ahead now.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As
    he ran next to Noriko, a thought suddenly occurred to him. The
    screaming, their hasty footsteps, and the officer warning them to
    stop all receded as his mind was occupied with this thought.</font></font></p>
    <p class="western" > <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
    might have been inappropriate. And besides...he'd ripped it off. </font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Oh,
    man.</i></font></font></p>
    <p class="western" >
    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But
    still he thought this:</font></font></p>

    <font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font ><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Together

    Takami was born in 1969 in Amagasaki near Osaka and grew up in Kagawa
    Prefecture of Shikoku, where he currently resides. After graduating
    from Osaka University with a degree in literature, he dropped out of
    Nihon University's liberal arts correspondence-course program. From
    1991 to 1996 he worked for the prefectural news company Shikoku

    received widespread support, particularly from young readers, and
